Lazarus Chakwera swears in Complaints Tribunal members
President Lazarus Chakwera Thursday sworn in three members of the first ever Complaints Tribunal for the National Intelligence Service (NIS) with a call for them to uphold principles of justice fairness and accountability. The three are Judge Redson Kapindu, human rights and social justice lawyer Sarai Chisala-Tempelhoff and former security officer Brenant Chitanda. Speaking during the swearing-in ceremony at Kamuzu Palace in Lilongwe, Chakwera said the nation has put on their shoulders a crucial responsibility of upholding justice, fairness, and accountability within NIS operations, arguing that this is not an easy task by any stretch of the imagination. “The main function of the service then was to protect the political hegemony of the colonial government which was maintained in the one party state. Although intelligence was formally delinked from the Malawi Police Service in 2000, where it was called the Security and Intelligence Service, its politicisation continued. And so, today, we have entrusted you to see to it that this legacy of political compromise does not continue, for the NIS exists to serve all Malawians, not any political agenda,” he said. The law established the NIS as an independent state institution that reports to the President according to Section 3 of the Act.

Ifmis hiccups choke Ombudsman’s office
Ombudsman Grace Malera has disclosed that her organisation failed to access K58.33 million in the 2022-23 fiscal year due to technical challenges in the Integrated Financial Management Information System (Ifmis). Malera disclosed this in Lilongwe Tuesday, when she presented an annual report of her office to the Legal Affairs Committee of Parliament. She said failure to access the funds culminated in a backlog of cases and failure of some investigations that have to be carried out. “The failure also contributed to prolonged delays in finalising the computation of past pension liabilities for members of staff that were in employment before 1st July 2012,” Malera said. She also bemoaned the information blackout given to her office by some government agencies. “In the year under review, the Office of the Ombudsman faced a lot of challenges like outright unresponsiveness by some ministries, departments and agencies (MDAs),” Malera said. Legal Affairs Committee Chairperson Albert Mbawala has since warned that all MDAs that are not complying with the Ombudsman’s determinations will soon face the law. “We have asked the Ombudsman to give us names of MDAs that are not complying with determinations of her office so that they should face our committee. “We will make sure that we follow up on funding issues with the Treasury and during the mid-term meeting of Parliament soon,” Mbawala said The report has, among other things, highlighted that women continue to lag behind when it comes to reporting complaints to the Office of the Ombudsman. This has been attributed to low education levels of most women compared to men as well as cultural beliefs. Meanwhile, Office of the Ombudsman Executive Secretary Alinafe Malunga has disclosed that the office is owing its landlord almost K50 million in rental arrears from October 2022 to June this year. “Ministry of Lands has only been committing to pay the outstanding rentals, forcing the landlord to issue notices of closure to the office many times,” Malunga said The report has indicated that 1,947 complaints were handled by the Ombudsman in the year under review, out of which 291 were newly received and 1,656 were carried over from the year 2021.

‘Strengthen digital transformation’
By Brenda Kayo; The National Registration Bureau (NRB) has asked Malawians to embrace digital technology for socio-economic transformation. Principal Secretary for NRB Mphatso Sambo made the call in Lilongwe yesterday at a Project Validation Workshop on Inclusive Digital Transformation. “NRB is, in partnership with the United Nations Development Programme (UNDP), working on designing a project on Inclusive Digital Public Infrastructure, which will help in stimulating economic activities in the digital era and bring about transformative changes, thereby fostering inclusive growth. “By utilising digital public infrastructure, NRB will be providing universal legal identity to all Malawian citizens, who will be identified in every transaction they need to make, whether in Malawi or outside Malawi. In fact, digitalisation is one of the enablers of the economic development of this country,” he said. UNDP Deputy Representative Challa Getachew said, as the world is going digital, Malawi should not be left behind. He said inclusive digital transformation leverages digital technologies and initiatives in a manner that ensures equal access, benefits and opportunities for all individuals and communities regardless of their socio-economic status and geographical location. “Most of the payments, most of the transactions, are going online and the world is going to go digital as we proceed in the coming years. Malawi cannot be left behind and Malawi’s rural population, which is at 85 percent of the whole population, needs to get access to technology,” he said. Malawi Communications Regulatory Authority Director General Daud Suleman commended the move which, he said, would help Malawi become an inclusive community and make a digital future possible. “It is important that all players that are involved— from an identity perceptive, an infrastructure perceptive and from government perceptive— must align so that this digital transformation which we are seeking is on board and every one should see this future,” he said. NRB is testing the prototype of digital identification and plans to launch it in 2024 with technical support from UNDP.

33 rivers risk flooding—Ministry
The Ministry of Water and Sanitation has, through the Department of Water Resources, observed that at least 33 major rivers across the country risk flooding due to rainfall activities in the past few days. The ministry says, in a statement released Monday, that the hydrometric monitoring system indicates that a substantial number of rivers are experiencing high water levels. The rivers include Likhubula, Likangala, Mkulumadzi, Lisungwe, Mtemang’ombe, Nkasi, Phalombe, Mombezi, Domasi, Naisi, Thutchira and Ruo in the Southern Region. The Central Region has Lingadzi, Lilongwe Linthipe, Rusa, Kasangazi, Mpasadzi, Lifuliza, Dwabanzi, Dwangwa, Bua and Nkula. In the Northern Region, rivers to watch out for include Luweya, South Rukuru, Kasitu, Lunyang’wa, North Rukuru, Lufira, Makeye, Songwe, Nyungwe and Chambo. “The ministry emphasises that given the current high-water levels and saturated soils, ongoing rainfall may lead to riverine floods in these areas. The public is strongly advised to exercise caution and remain vigilant for the potential occurrence of floods. “The public is further advised to pay attention to the continuously available updates on water levels/floods from the Department of Water Resources to be safe from any flood-related threats. The ministry has since asked Malawians to exercise caution when crossing rivers or engaging in any activities within these water bodies,” the statement reads. Currently, the Department of Disaster Management Affairs (Dodma) has indicated that around 14 councils have been affected by disasters, mainly stormy rains, strong winds and lightning since the onset of the 2023-24 rainy season. The affected councils include Chiradzulu, Dowa, Kasungu, Lilongwe, Mangochi, Mulanje, Mchinji, Nkhata Bay, Nkhotakota, Ntcheu, Nsanje, Rumphi, Salima and Thyolo. The disasters have affected approximately 21,379 people; that is, 4,751 households. Additionally, the department recorded five deaths (all caused by lightning strikes) and 46 injuries, primarily due to stormy rains, with 29 males and 17 females among the injured.

87% access farm inputs
By Deborah Madeya: Agriculture Minister Sam Kawale has said 87.4 percent of the 1.5 million Affordable Inputs Programme (AIP) beneficiaries have accessed inputs. He attributed the development to government’s steadfastness in addressing problems that have been flagged by beneficiaries. Kawale cited the arrest of vendors who attempted to buy fertiliser illegally as a manifestation of quick action taken on issues raised. “Right now, there are over 70 court cases involving those who were involved in the illegal purchase of fertiliser,” he said. Kawale was optimistic that the remaining 12.6 percent would be reached in due course. “We delivered fertiliser to hard-to-reach areas first and we will continue distributing fertiliser until everyone eligible has benefitted. “There are some points where we over-delivered and, so, the ministry is planning to shift that fertiliser to other places we have not reached yet,” Kawale said. Out of the 1.5 million beneficiaries, 1,490,000 are accessing fertiliser while the remaining 10,000 are accessing goats. Meanwhile, agricultural policy expert Ronald Chilumpha has said there is a need for the government to implement the reformed AIP. “Last year, government talked about a reformed AIP but we haven’t seen much of that in this season. “We want to see a diversified AIP; one that looks beyond farming. There are some areas that do not do well with maize, such that there is a need for them to be given an opportunity to grow other types of crops,” Chilumpha said. He added that the government should consider graduating from AIP and direct the money to other aspects of agriculture, including agriculture research and infrastructure development, for the country to achieve food security. “The money we are putting into AIP can be directed to irrigation schemes. As you know, the country lags behind, in terms of irrigation farming. “During seasons like this one, when the weather is unpredictable, irrigation can help the country meet its food security goals,” Chilumpha said.

Maputo Embassy chaos worries Public Accounts Committee
The Public Accounts Committee (Pac) of Parliament has expressed worry over perceived chaos at Malawi’s embassy in Maputo, Mozambique. Pac members expressed concern when officials from the Ministry of Foreign Affairs appeared before committee members to answer queries raised in the Auditor General (AG)’s report for the year ended June 2021. During the engagement, it was revealed that payments worth over K424 million were made without raising payment vouchers between November 2019 and June 2020. Committee members were also told that funds amounting to K11,324, 625 paid by an insurance company as compensation for a damaged vehicle used by a defence attaché were used for some other use other than replacing the damaged vehicle. Responding to the issue of money spent without raising vouchers, Principal Secretary (Legal) in the Ministry of Foreign Affairs Mary Kachale, who led the delegation, admitted that the observation made by the AG on the matter was accurate. “As you are aware, the payment process is an accounting function that requires a competent accountant. Unfortunately, there was no accountant who could undertake such functions “I am pleased to inform the honourable committee, honourable chairperson and honourable committee members, that the ministry has filled the vacant post and all accounting functions are being discharged accordingly,” Kachale said. However, Pac Vice Chairperson Ned Poya said it looks like the Mozambique Embassy is a playground for most people. “It’s kind of free for all. Imagine an embassy which doesn’t even know the date on which they purchased their assets… It’s free for all. And even the language in the letters shows that there is something wrong,” Poya said.

Lazarus Chakwera lauds John Chilembwe vision
By Isaac Salima President Lazarus Chakwera has said his government will ensure that it continues implementing development projects in line with the vision that anti-colonial rule master Reverend John Chilembwe had for Malawi. The President said this at Providence Industrial Mission (PIM) in Chiradzulu District Monday, when he presided over activities marking Chilembwe Day. Chakwera said the reverend wanted the country to be liberated from bondage, hence the need to prolong such a vision. “His first vision was on education, where he put all his heart. He did not want to rely on others in the provision of education [services]. When education and digitalisation feature highly in Malawi 2063, they are derived from Chilembwe’s vision. “Soon, we will be opening 500 schools which the government has been constructing with support from [United States of] America and this is all about improving education [standards] in the country as Chilembwe wanted,” he said. He further said he would ensure that his leadership promotes industrialisation, just as Chilembwe aspired. “Chilembwe wanted the country to be food self-reliant, which is in accordance with our industrialisation drive. It is unfortunate that when Ngwazi [late President Hastings Kamuzu Banda] opened factories, the regime that followed later dismantled everything,” he said. Chakwera then said Chilembwe Day is a day of reflection on the sacrifice Chilembwe made to Malawi. He said Chilembwe loved the country and put aside his personal interest, such that he died fighting for the country. In recognition of the fallen anti-colonial activist, Chakwera has declared that Phalombe District Hospital will now be called Chilembwe District Hospital. The event started with the laying of wreaths, where Chakwera, First Lady Monica and Vice President Saulos Chilima led Malawians in laying wreaths at PIM Memorial Tower. The event was held under the theme ‘Extend Our Territory Lord’. PIM President Wilson Mitambo said it is high time the country focused on God as it seeks answers to challenges it is facing. “We should unite in asking God to extend our territory. The country has been facing a lot of challenges but this is time to leave everything aside and join hands in praying to God to hear us out,” Mitambo said.

K1 billion needed for tourism marketing
By Cathy Maulidi: The Ministry of Tourism needs about K1 billion to market the country, Director of Administration in the Ministry of Tourism Esther Nyirenda told Parliament Tuesday. Nyirenda told the Public Accounts Committee of Parliament that apart from marketing the country as a tourism destination, the ministry is advocating domestic tourism. “We need to market our country to both local and international tourists and doing that, needs a lot of resources. “We have our officers attached to embassies who help us market our country and we also reach out to people who can do marketing for us. We advertise and when they apply and meet what we want, we sign contracts with them so that they should be marketing Malawi while in their countries,” Nyirenda said. She cited high rates in hospitality units as one of the major hindrances to growing the tourism sector. According to Nyirenda, the ministry will launch its tourism marketing strategy by September 2023. But Public Accounts Committee of Parliament Vice Chairperson Ned Poya said the K1 billion amount is way too high. According to Poya, the country can save resources if it markets its tourist attraction centres on digital platforms. “We don’t need to entirely rely on individuals who go country to country to sell our country. We can use digital platforms. Just go on the internet and search Dubai tourist attraction centers, you will find a lot of places there, Malawi can also do the same,” Poya said. The ministry officials has since the country’s poor road network saying it is affecting the sector.

MCCCI trashes Escom on tariff increment proposal
By Wezzie Gausi: Malawi Confederation of Chambers of Commerce and Industry (MCCCI) has quashed State-run Electricity Supply Corporation of Malawi (Escom)’s proposal to increase electricity tariffs by 69.7 percent in the next four years. This came out during the second public hearing on the proposal organised by the Malawi Energy Regulatory Authority (Mera) in Lilongwe Wednesday. Escom recently reviewed its electricity tariff adjustments proposal from 99 percent to 69 percent. MCCCI Chief Executive Officer Chancellor Kaferapanjira said there is no justification for Escom to ask for such an increase. He said, in 2018, the utility company asked for another adjustment which it justified by saying it was meant for implementation of several projects which did not materialise. “As an institution we say no to this tariff increment. If Mera is to accept this application, the tariff should be reduced to 40 percent, meaning a 10 percent increase every year for the next four years,” Kaferapanjira said. Economics Association of Malawi Secretary General Andrew Kumbatira said for the country to realise economic growth, the energy sector has to be vibrant. He said all countries that are doing well economically have uninterrupted electricity connections. “As Ecama, we accept this tariff increment on the basis that our economy is in shambles but, however, we need to be realistic with the percentage at which the tariff will be adjusted with,” Kumbatira said. Consumers Association of Malawi Executive Director John Kapito said it was unfortunate that Escom was asking for such an increase. He said it is high time Escom put its house in order for people to trust its functionality. “This is not what we were expecting from Escom but we believe Mera has a final say and we will make sure they do the right thing on the tariff increment application,” Kapito said. Mera Chief Executive Officer Henry Kachaje said it is Mera’s mandate to solicit views before accepting or denying tariff increase applications. He said these consultations will be done in all the three regions. “We are taking into account what people are proposing and, by the end of the day, we will have to sit down and consolidate all the views and come up with a decision which will also be made known to the public,” Kachaje said. A review of the just ended base tariff (2018 to 2022) has shown that Escom failed in almost all its agreed Key Performance Indicators.

NBS Bank profit up 146 percent in 2022
Malawi Stock Exchange-listed NBS Bank has posted a K18.9 billion profit for the year ending December 31 2022. This represents a 146 percent jump in the profit from K7.7 billion made in 2021. The announcement was made during the bank’s annual general meeting in Blantyre Monday. The bank also declared a K2.6 billion final dividend, representing K0.90 per share, bringing total dividend pay out to K9.6 billion. The dividend is 50 percent of the bank’s total profit and it has increased by 231 percent from K2.93 billion paid out in 2021. NBS Bank Chairperson Vizenge Kumwenda said, over the past five years, the bank has intensified efforts in investing in technology to support digital transactions. “The investments allowed the bank to offer convenience and significantly improved customer service, which in turn contributed to growing transaction volumes and related income. “Further, customers entrusted the bank with more deposits in 2022 as manifested in the growth of customer deposits by 67 percent year-on-year,” Kumwenda said. He said results of a customer survey for 2022 demonstrated that the bank’s customers were satisfied and loyal to the brand. This, according to Kumwenda, is a reflection of the effort the bank has been making in addressing customer “pain points” and positioning itself in the digital era. Minority Shareholder of Listed Companies General Secretary Frank Harawa lauded the bank for the positive performance, describing it as satisfactory. “We are happy that, this time around, we are sharing K9 billion in dividends from around K3 billion in 2021. We can only hope that this performance continues,” Harawa said.

Treasury raises tax target by K69 billion
The Treasury has raised the tax revenue target for the Malawi Revenue Authority (MRA) by K69 billion in the last three months of the 2023-24 financial year, Commissioner General John Bizwick has disclosed. Bizwick was speaking when he presented Commissioner General Awards to outstanding MRA stations which have sparkled in the first nine months of the fiscal year. The MRA chief said, initially, the tax collector was expected to collect K218 billion in January this year but that following the revision, the target has jumped to K245 billion. In February, MRA was initially expected to collect K155 billion which has now increased to K174 billion. The tax revenue target for March has been increased from K176 billion to K199 billion. Bizwick was optimistic that the tax collector would meet the revenue targets. “I am very, very confident that we should be able to collect that,” Bizwick said. He noted that the Commissioner General Awards are one way of energising the team to work hard and collect more. During the award ceremony, MRA presented awards in the areas Relegation Threatened Stations, Rising Stars, Hat Trick award and the overall Golden Boot award. MRA’s Large Taxpayers Office, which is mandated to collect about 70 percent of the total tax revenue, emerged the best performing station and carted home the Golden Boot award. MRA Deputy Commissioner for Large Taxpayers Office Rose Ngwira hailed her team for the strong performance. Ngwira also praised large taxpayers for paying taxes in time, which has resulted in the station performing above all MRA stations. According to MRA, the awards are designed to motivate stations to perform even better.

Tobacco Commission commences  tobacco survey
By Brenda Kayo: The Tobacco Commission (TC) has started the first round of crop assessment for the 2023-24 tobacco farming season to determine how much tobacco the country could produce this year. TC spokesperson Telephorus Chigwenembe said the exercise will run from January 15 to February 2. According to Chigwenembe, authorities will visit tobacco growing areas in the country for data collection. “We are requesting tobacco farmers to provide our teams with correct information because it is the correct information that enables the commission to come up with credible estimates that are used by players in the economy,” he said. He, however, said, so far, farmers have been licensed with quotas worth 248 million kilogrammes (kg) of all types of tobacco. The commission has since extended the licencing period to January 31 2024. Chigwenembe, however, said there will be no penalties and growers can pay for their registration and licencing after they sell their tobacco. Recently, the commission announced that there is an increase in seedbed area and planned hectares for this year’s tobacco production. In the 2022-23 farming season, 120 million kg of tobacco valued at $282.6 million was sold at an average price of $2.35.

Egenco hopeful on steady power generation, supply
Electricity Generation Company (Egenco) has expressed optimism on a steady supply of electricity during this year’s rainy season. The hope comes as the company has concluded maintenance works at Nkula B, effectively ending power outages of both Nkula A and B stations which affected power supply in the country over the weekend. In a statement, Egenco says intake screens which were dislodged at Nkula B have been replaced. The company also says it discovered a huge tree at its main inlet valve for machine 4 which has been removed. “As at 00:15hrs, all machines at both stations were back online and normalisation was complete. We thank our entire stakeholder and the public for your understanding and patience during this period,” the statement reads. Egenco Senior Public Relations Officer Moses Gwaza in an interview yesterday said the maintenance at Nkula B was part of preparations for the rainy season. “As you might be aware, once you have the intake screen dislodged, it means that anything can go into the machines. “So, to prevent that, we had to take out the power plant so that we have all the screens intact so that when we start cleaning the trash that normally comes with the rains, the machines are protected,” he said. Ironically, most parts of Mzuzu City had no power at the time of this story, which Gwaza said could be a local transmission problem. Commenting on the issue on Egenco’s Facebook page John Mlenga from Zolozolo Township said it is good that the company has moved in to rectify the problem though his township had no lights yet. “Good work Egenco even though we are in blackout in Mzuzu Zolozolo Botanic,” he said. Nkula A and B stations, which have a combined generation capacity of 135.1 megawatts, were shut down on January 13 to allow for maintenance works at Nkula B.

Government borrows K1.8 trillion in 2023
The government’s borrowing through Treasury bills and Treasury notes in 2023 amounted to K1.8 trillion, with a marginal increase by 0.7 percent compared to 2022. This is according to the Bridgepath Capital Annual Report covering 2023. The report says during the 12-month period to December 2022, the government used Treasury notes and Treasury bills to borrow K1.83 trillion. The local financial advisory firm attributes the marginal increase to increasing fiscal deficits, which are being financed through both domestic and foreign borrowing. “The closing average TB yield increased to 18.90 percent in 2023 from 16.67 percent in 2022. Likewise, the closing average TN yield increased to 29.95 percent in 2023 from 25.7 percent in 2022,” the report reads. During the 2023-24 government fiscal year, the overall fiscal balance was estimated at a deficit of K1.32 trillion, which is 8.7 percent of GDP, an improvement of 0.01 percent from the previous year’s 8.8 percent likely outcome. The then minister of Finance and Economic Affairs Sosten Gwengwe said the deficit was to be financed through foreign borrowing amounting to K288.78 billion and domestic borrowing amounting to K1.19 trillion. During the 2024-25 pre-budget consultation, the Institute of Chartered Accountants in Malawi and the Malawi Confederation of Chambers of Commerce and Industry asked the government to work towards managing its debt. Icam Chief Executive Officer Noel Zigowa said borrowing is detrimental to the country’s economy because a lot of money is spent on interest payment, which cannot help the country to grow. “The government should manage existing debt and negotiate for better interests going forward because, as a country, we cannot continue spending huge amounts of money on interest,” he said. Speaking during the consultations, Minister of Finance and Economic Affairs Simplex Chithyola Banda said the government is working towards making sure that debt is sustainable. “The government has set out the macroeconomic framework for the 2024-25 budget that looks at the macroeconomic targets such as fiscal and monetary policy measures and the debt sustainability targets to be achieved by the end of the fiscal year,” Banda said. By November last year, Malawi’s total public debt stock had increased from K10.60 trillion to K12.56 trillion.

Paulina Chiziane: Mozambique’s grand novelist, finally receives her prestigious award
Paulina Chiziane, the first woman to publish a novel in Mozambique, has become the first African woman to receive the most important award for Portuguese literature, the Camões Prize. S She’s also the first to break all the rules about what a writer may reveal about Mozambique’s patriarchal culture and social taboos. Born in Manjacaze in 1955 and raised in the capital, Maputo, Chiziane’s mother tongue is Chopi, a Bantu language spoken along the southern coast of Mozambique, which she practised along with Portuguese, the language imposed during the colonial period. Today Chiziane has a degree in linguistics and is a leading global figure in Portuguese literature. Speaking in a TV interview from the yard of her house in Zambezia province about winning the 2021 Camões Prize, she said: “This prize is for all the people of my country, because I always wrote from a collective experience, transmitting a collective voice … even if my novels are written in the first person.” She finally received the award in person at a ceremony in Lisbon in May 2023 – the annual event had been suspended during the Covid-19 pandemic. Named after the famed 16th century Portuguese poet Luís de Camões, the Camões Prize was first awarded in 1988 to recognise great literature in Portuguese. In her speech in Lisbon, Chiziane said: “I was walking without knowing my direction, and yet I arrived somewhere. “I come from Africa. I am black, and I am here, being the first black woman to receive this high recognition … I am black. Yes, and so what? “If you want to be someone in life, in this world, you need to affirm your space. Leave traces of your feet on the ground, indelibly engraved, for other people to say: here someone has passed.” As a scholar of comparative literature who has researched African writing in Portuguese, I have followed Chiziane’s career and wish to shed some light on the work of this important writer and activist. Her groundbreaking novels and short stories have not all been translated into English and French, limiting her recognition in Africa. Her protagonists Chiziane’s first novelBalada de Amor ao Vento (Ballad of Love in the Wind)(1990) is a powerful story about a rural woman trapped in a patriarchal system. It anticipates her most famous novel, the 2002Niketche:A Story of Polygamy,awarded the José Craveirinha Prize. Set in the south of Mozambique, it exposes the trials that Niketche must endure in a polygamous household. Chiziane’s protagonists are characterised by a profound loneliness and sadness. They are victims of the painful subjugation of women that is still normalised — and seldom publicly discussed — in some regions of the country. She writes in absolute terms, revealing the good and the bad in society, and the emotions she evokes are extreme. And yet these women face their burdens and bear them bravely, discreetly and with dignity. A life in service Chiziane’s stories often reflect the social instability of a country oppressed by a war of liberation that was followed by civil conflicts after independence from Portugal in 1975. They reflect her commitment to the Frelimo liberation movement. During the civil war of 1977 to 1992, she joined the Red Cross humanitarian organisation as a volunteer. This allowed her to observe the suffering of her people up close. Some of the most painful memories of that period converged in her second novel, the 1993 romanceVentos do Apocalipse (Winds of the Apocalypse). As a volunteer, she encountered a woman who at first confused her with her dead daughter, establishing a profound bond with her. The painful memory of that mother inspired her to write the book: “The two original names of the mother and the daughter, Minosse and Wusheni, are maintained in the novel as homage to that woman that has shaken my soul forever. I wish I could sit at her side now and tell her: of your tears I did this.” Chiziane went on to join the Nucleus of Feminine Association of Zambezia or Nafeza, a non-governmental organisation created in 1997. She was now fighting oppression through her literary works, as well as through political actions. Nafeza works at strengthening and coordinating the efforts of the country’s female associations and community-based organisations to improve women’s lives on all levels. Currently, Chiziane advises on the development of international aid projects focused on conflict and the defence of women’s rights and dignity. Social realities and taboos Her third novel,O Setimo Juramento (The Seventh Pledge)in 2000, is again focused on daily life and the female condition. This time the context is the city. The work explores the strategies women have developed to cope with the social inferiority they face. In a context of political and economic corruption, a group of women who were meant to be rivals band together to improve their lives. Through tapping into a geography of the country’s imagination – with its legends and myths that crash against the concrete realities of urban life – Chiziane constructs a powerful allegory about Mozambique’s socio-cultural conditions, especially for women. Here actual development is destined only for the elite few, while the rest wander through a forest of symbols that make them question what is real and what is not. Outspoken voice Chiziane is prolific. She is also the author of numerous other novels and short stories. But apart fromNiketche:A Story of Polygamy, none are available in English. Her 2015 novelNgoma Yethu:O Curandeiro e o Novo Testamento (Ngoma Yethu: the Healer and the Old Testament)is, however, due to be published in English in 2024. Ngoma Yethu created quite a scandal in Mozambique, especially because it was written by a woman (who are not supposed to talk about the rituals or the role of the nyanga or traditional healer) and for firmly denouncing the demonisation of traditional African spiritual beliefs by the Catholic Church. Chiziane has remained unwavering in amplifying women’s voices in her country. Her literary path has already made history and the Camões Prize, now officially celebrated, is a testament to the enormous importance of her role in representing African culture in the context of Portuguese-speaking countries. –The Conversation

Chef Ipyana dares fellow chefs
Blantyre-based chef Ipyana Mwagomba on Saturday challenged fellow chefs in the country to be creative and innovative by making own Malawian dishes. Chef Ipyana, who has fashioned goat soup and has christened himself The King of Goat Soup, said time has come for chefs in the country to come out and contribute to development of Malawi through tourism. “As chefs, we are artists and so, we need to have our own signature dishes and sell Malawi to the world. We need to feed tourists and fellow Malawians with own dishes,” he said. The chef organised a special event at Amaryllis Hotel in Blantyre on Saturday. The dine with chef Ipyana event, which also acted as a warm up to Driemo’s Mzaliwa album launch at Comesa Hall on the same night, attracted renowned artists such as Soldier Lucius Banda, Kell Kay, Saint and Miss Malawi second princess Roberta Kanjelo. “Local dishes are a huge tool for growing our tourism. I am happy that goat soup is now five star and I am excited to have served celebrities such as Soldier Lucius Banda and Driemo,” he said. He said goat soap, which includes goat meat, mixture of vegetables and herbs, is fresh and that it is tasty. Lucius said he has been hearing about goat soup for some time and he was happy to taste it. “I encourage chef Ipyana to grow it and have it in different places so that people can enjoy it,” he said.

No debut for The Kingstons show
The Kingstons reality show failed to premiere on Times Television on Friday night, which irked viewers. The much-awaited reality show was expected to premiere at 8:30pm on the award winning television station. In a statement posted on Times360 Facebook, Times Television said “due to reasons beyond our control, we are unable to bring you the premiere of The Kingstons tonight”. The television went on to say that the premiere would be aired as soon as the matter was rectified before an introduction of the first episode was served. The reality show is set to feature the hottest couple of award-winning Amapiano star Zeze and Dorothy, who is a fashionista and business woman. Times Television Station Manager Wonder Msiska, who was rueful, could not be drawn to comment on the issue, maintaining that they had made a statement and that they would come back with more details once the technical glitches had been rectified. Last week, Msiska said they were happy about the Kingstons reality show project, being the first of its kind on the local entertainment scene and to feature the most followed couple in showbiz. “As Times Television, which is the number one television station in the country, we pride ourselves in taking on new challenges and breaking boundaries with our content,” Msiska said. He added that The Kingstons reality show is bringing to the screen all that raw, behind-the-scenes daily life of their package for viewers. Despite the no-debut for the reality show, Times Television held a launch event at Amaryllis Hotel in Blantyre, where they engaged various players to support The Kingstons’ reality show. Having been served with snacks during the red carpet event, the patrons, including friends and relatives of the Kingstons, then were treated to the introduction of the first episode. And then after host of the event Times Television presenter Yankho Seunda said that the event was over, The Kingstons appeared for interaction with the patrons before taking photographs. The couple engaged in December last year in Blantyre during an occasion that attracted several people. Zeze recently bagged two awards for Best Artist of the Year and Secular Song of the Year for ‘Kusangalala’ during the 2023 Entertainers of the Year led by MBC. The award-winning musician said recently that he has always loved sharing his life with people around him and that The Kingstons reality show offers him that opportunity. “The show is not just showbiz, but also a platform for us to share with Malawians our life behind the limelight,” the ‘Mphaka’ creator said. Dorothy also said she felt honoured to be one of the first Malawians to star in a reality show with her hubby. “This is mostly seen as an impossible and foreign concept. This show is breaking boundaries and showing the world that we can,” she said. The Kingstons reality show is being produced in partnership with Smile Media Group, a local multimedia production and advertising agency.

Shemu Joyah still in it with Chilembwe film
Despite facing the challenge of funding, veteran award winning filmmaker Shemu Joyah remains steadfast to produce a film for one of the country’s heroes John Chilembwe. This comes as the country today commemorates Chilembwe, a Baptist pastor, educator and revolutionary who trained as a minister in the United States, returning to Nyasaland, now Malawi, in 1901. He was an early figure in the resistance to colonialism, opposing both the treatment of Africans working in agriculture on European-owned plantations and the colonial government’s failure to promote the social and political advancement of Africans. Having managed to receive funding from Copyright Fund spearheaded by Copyright Society of Malawi (Cosoma), Joyah, the brains behind films such asSeasons of A LifeandThe Last Fishing Boat,said shooting for the Chilembwe trailer will be done within the next two months. “We are almost through with all the preparations,” he said. Joyah has said the budget for the Chilembwe movie is huge. “I have not revisited the budget for the Chilembwe film for a while and so I do not have accurate figures at the moment. There are many changes that have happened since I first started working on the project,” he said. But is he frustrated that the project to shoot the Chilembwe film has taken long? “I have to be realistic with my expectations. This is Malawi; so, I am not frustrated. Being frustrated would mean being frustrated with being a Malawian, which I cannot manage to do. Everything has its own time and the Chilembwe film’s time will come,” he said.

Drinking from the Cosmic Gourd: How Amos Tutuola can Change our Minds
Amos Tutuola deserves contemplation as a writer independent of the clutches of anthropology, argues Sanya Osha. How can we foster such a critical approach? The quirky title of Brian Eno and David Byrne’s 1981 avant-funk albumMy Life in the Bush of Ghostscomes from the most unexpected of sources: Amos Tutuola’s 1954 novel of the same name. This obscure homage is perhaps more intriguing than Dylan Thomas’s famous, generally complimentary review ofThe Palm-Wine Drinkard:‘brief, thronged, grisly and bewitching’. Thomas, that pivotal British post-war figure, embraced poetry in a whole-hearted, unconscious, even elemental way. Eno and Byrne, by contrast—especially in their most well-known collaboration,The Talking Heads—seem more ambivalent about the power of their medium of choice, and their status as ‘famous musicians’. Because of his uneasy relationship with Literature-with-a-capital-L, one always hopes to read a work on Tutuola that contextualises him properly within modern, global literary history. But, perhaps most importantly, one also hopes to be shown a means of discovering how to reread Tutuola; to return him to literature, where he originally belongs; to de-anthropologise him, so that we can experience his jagged poetry afresh. Francis B Nyamnjoh, inDrinking from the Cosmic Gourd: How Amos Tutuola Can Change our Minds,has not adopted such an approach. Instead, he defaults to the paradigm that casts Tutuola as an arrowhead in the perennial struggle between peripheral knowledge and dominant discourse. Viewed as an exotic, somewhat amusing cultural curiosity by Western readers, and considered an anachronistic embarrassment by the African literary establishment—comprising university-trained critics who were simply scandalised by the manner in which he used the English language—Tutuola has remained in an anomalous position between literature and anthropology, disciplines that have often colluded in discrediting him. Wittingly or otherwise, because of his apparent lack of verbal sophistication Tutuola from the very beginning made himself the butt of postcolonial anthropology, just as he himself made, albeit with canny mischief, a joke of the English language. Is it possible, now, to free him from this predicament? In several instances, Nyamnjoh, at first, seems to indicate so. He indicts, for example, the standard anthropological treatments applied to Tutuola, reminding us that colonial anthropology with its spectrum of infantilisations is largely inhumane to its colonial subjects—with onward consequences for its place in postcolonial discourse. It should be pointed out that as a social anthropologist Nyamnjoh is quite critical of his discipline’s attitude towards Tutuola, and he is not, in fact, supportive of most of its readings of the author and his work. But by arguing that apparently rustic denizens such as Tutuola ‘are the very same Africans to whom the modern intellectual elite in their ivory towers [try] to deny the right to think and represent their realities in accordance with civilisations and universes they know best,’ Nyamnjoh keeps Tutuola quartered in anthropology’s terrain, where his ill treatment continues, and further prevents his liberation into the freer spaces of art. Born in 1920 in Abeokuta, Western Nigeria, to cocoa farmers, Tutuola had just six years of formal schooling. His parents were Christians, a background that accounts for the myths, symbols and fables that colour his extravagant fiction. Had he written in Pidgin, the dialect of postcolonial linguistic subversion and—vitally—reinvention, Tutuola may have been classed as a brave pioneer, as were other far-sighted postcolonial Pidgin experimentalists. Fela Anikulapo Kuti, for one, demonstrated the protean possibilities of the idiom in both song and public discourse. But instead Tutuola tackled a medium—fully-fledged English—that floored him. The rhythms of his language are quite peculiar; in not being a competent user of English, let alone a master of it, Tutola’s own prose frequently prevents full entry into his creative world. His gnarled diction causes the fragmenting of that world in ways that are often unpleasant rather than appealing. In the The Witch-Herbalist of the Remote Town, Tutuola’s offbeat prose is especially rocky: …it was a great pity that this man could not walk to the altar, because he was totally lame, the hump which was on his back or nape was big as a mound. Again, there was a goitre on his neck which was just like a hillock. So both hump and goitre were a heavy load for him to lift himself up from the ground or floor. Not only that, big boils were all over his body and each was as big as the head of a child. His forehead was deeply dented so much that there was not a person who would like to look at it twice. Despite the rather gruesome description above, the traditional Yoruba world Tutuola is preoccupied with is generally fluid and filled with luminous beauty. It requires the heightened powers of a poet to convey its startling plenitude, but Tutuola’s jagged and angular syntax—its fundamental disobedience of its master—often produces disastrous results. Tutuola’s editors at Faber and Faber did him a great disservice in retaining obviously awkward expressions and outright misspellings—for example ‘guord’ instead of ‘gourd’; see also ‘ghostesses’; and so on—in the name of preserving his originality. VS Naipaul—admittedly a man with questionable attitudes toward Africa and her descendents—complained that Tutuola’s English ‘is that of the West African schoolboy, an imperfectly acquired second language’. For his part, Peter du Sautoy of Faber remarked, as quoted by Nyamnjoh: We do, of course, realise that it [The Palm-Wine Drinkard] is not quite as good as it ought to be, but it is the unsophisticated product of a West African mind and we felt there was nothing to be done about it except leave it alone. When I say unsophisticated, that is not altogether true, since Tutuola has been to some extent influenced by at any rate the externals of Western civilisation. Despite being ‘unsophisticated’ (it becomes finally impossible to silence the tolling of the bells of colonial anthropology), Tutuola became Nigeria’s first internationally recognised author with the publication ofThe Palm-Wine Drinkard,which was released by Faber in 1952 and by Grove Press in the United States the following year. Wole Soyinka, among others, was quite vocal in attempting to get foreign publishers to pay the cash-strapped Tutuola his due during his lifetime. When he died in 1997, the fanfare that attended his death surpassed anything he was accorded by his cynical compatriots during his lifetime, but his burial itself was poorly attended, a reflection, perhaps, of the gap that lay between him and the literary establishment all his life. There is very little record of Tutuola explaining himself to the world—liberating himself, as it were, from the gaze and clutches of anthropology; bursting forth in speech and writing regarding his artistic process and existential predicament; stating, if you will: ‘Before you label me, I will name myself, and in this way, I shall indict and contradict you.’ And so Tutuola remains a sort of literary Sarah Baartman; mute, exoticised by the institutions of colonialism and, in death, the uneasy possessor of a hero’s welcome home. Despite these basic observations informing any critical appreciation of Tutuola, Nyamnjoh’s main strategy is to stress the complementary relationship between literature and anthropology, and to emphasise why the latter ought to seek interconnections with the former in order to bolster common understandings of social texts. There will always be a high degree of uncertainty around the manner in which Tutuola will be critically considered: nagging doubts about him being no more than a naive primitivist; misgivings about the worthiness of the literary sub-genre his writing gestures toward (call it ‘African magical beat’, if you will); and befuddlement concerning the cultural loss and confusing hybrids that are the result of the colonial encounter, both in Nigerian reality and in Tutuola’s mind. Fractured prisms, cracked mirrors—it is most probably through these purveyors of ‘what might have been’ that Tutuola is forever condemned to be judged. And yet there is a further context in which Tutuola’s art would make absolute sense: that supplied by Yoruba culture, with its lush pantheon of deities, cascading myths, self-perpetuating folklore and legends. Here, I believe, is where a viable literary approach to Tutuola’s work lies—one in which he continues in the footsteps of his illustrious artistic . As for Soyinka, his adoption of Ogun, the Yoruba deity of metallurgy, war and the lyric arts, remains the essential foundation of his own art. In the same vein, visual artists such as the Nigerian sculptor Twins Seven Seven and the Argentinian-born Bahian artist Carybé both celebrate ancient Yoruba cosmology and divinities in a manner in which their distinctiveness and power are inherently unquestioned. It is possible to give Tutuola a similar critical reception—that is, as a noteworthy explorer of the Yoruba cosmological universe. One hopes that one day this will be the norm, rather than the exception. Tutuola’s life and work evoke a vexing question: how can one be so vividly anti-literature and so dedicatedly pro-writing at the same time? You can be, if you are a historical misfit caught on the cusp of tumultuous colonial transformations, and able to create stories through a splintered, prefabricated, partially-undomesticated idiom, one that has shrugged off various foreign and domestic superstructures, and is wholly your own. —African Books Collective Note: The article has been trimmed to fit

The Kingstons reality show takes off  today
The much awaited Kingstons reality show premieres tonight from 8:30pm on Times Television. The reality show features the hottest couple of award winning Amapiano star Zeze and Dorothy, who is a fashionista and business woman. Times Television Station Manager Wonder Msiska said Thursday that they were excited to premiere the Kingstons’ reality show which he described as gift to Malawians considering the love and social connection that the socialite couple has with the public. “We are happy about this project being the first of its kind on the local entertainment scene and to feature the most followed couple in showbiz. As Times Television, which is the number one television station in the country, we pride ourselves in taking on new challenges and breaking boundaries with our content,” Msiska said. He said that shooting and packaging of the first season has been in progress since they made the first notice and that they were delighted to invite viewers “to make a date with the first episode”. “People know Zeze as undisputedly the biggest artist in Malawi right now with accolades and hit songs hanging all over him. People know Dorothy as a socialite, fashionista and business woman who is loved and followed by many on social media. But there is more to these people,” he said. Msiska said the couple has low and high pressure moments, family moments and tense moments and all other moments every couple or family can go through. “So, The Kingstons reality show is bringing to the screen all that raw, behind-the-scenes daily life of their package for our viewers,” he said. The couple engaged in December last year in Blantyre during an occasion that pulled several people. Zeze recently bagged two awards for Best Artist of the Year and Secular Song of the Year for ‘Kusangalala’ during the 2023 Entertainers of the Year spearheaded by MBC. The Times Television Station Manager said that the reality show to be watched and followed by millions of viewers, locally and beyond, will have 12 episodes broadcast on Times Television and Times 360 Malawi on Facebook from 8:30pm every Friday.

National Women’s Football Association lobbies for more delegates
National Women’s Football Association (NWFA) Chairperson Adelaide Migogo caused a stir during Football Association of Malawi (Fam)’s annual general meeting (AGM) when she proposed for an increased number of delegates from the current two. The issue attracted heated debate as other Fam member associations welcomed the idea. Migogo said Fam’s constitution must be amended to ensure that all affiliates are equally represented during the AGM. “NWFA is requesting the general assembly for a consideration on the number of delegates. We have noted that, though we speak of equality and fair play in football, when it comes to representation in the AGM, we are not doing well. It will be great for the number of delegates from each member association to be equal, whether six or eight from each association,” Migogo said. Super League of Malawi (Sulom) Executive Member Daud Mtanthiko said it was a serious matter which needed immediate consideration. “As we promote women’s football, let us consider all sectors including their representation at the general assembly. Equity and equality must be in all Fam member associations,” Mtanthiko said. Sulom Treasurer Allie Mwachande said NWFA is not inferior. “Why should it be represented by only two people while others are represented by six delegates? This should be taken into consideration,” he said. Beach Soccer Association Chairperson Gift Chimbalanga shared the sentiments. “It is time to recognise women’s football in all spheres. I support the proposal to amend the constitution so that more members from the women’s body attend the assembly. There is no difference between Sulom and them,” he said. Fam President Walter Nyamilandu said it was a genuine concern and assured the assembly that the association would engage Fifa on the matter. Meanwhile, Migogo has asked for increased funding and capacity building. “We appreciate the support that women’s football is getting from Fam but operationally we feel we can do better. We are therefore requesting more deliberate involvement of the NWFA members as part of the capacity building. This should include involvement in the various Fam committees. “As a National Association, a subvention of K10 million only covers for one Exco meeting and a few operational activities. With the tasks that we have to grow the women’s game at grassroots, we need a special consideration for us to support our structures at district and regional level as part of the development agenda of the women’s game,” she said.

Netball World Cup role delights Waya
Netball icon Mary Waya has promised to give impartial analysis after SuperSport named her one of the analysts for the 2023 Netball World Cup finals. SuperSport is expected to beam the first Netball World Cup on the continent which is expected to run from July 28 to August 6 in Cape Town, South Africa. In a statement released on Friday, Waya, a former Malawi National Netball Team goal-shooter and coach, has been named as one of the three analysts representing Africa. “Seasoned broadcasters Jenny Woods, Caroline Barker and Sue Gaudion will also be in the mix. The rest of the African continent will be represented by Mary Waya, who has played more than 200 matches for Malawi, Ruth Meeme, who represented Uganda at the 2015 and 2019 World Cups, and Perpetua Siyachitema, who captained Zimbabwe at the 2019 Netball World Cup,” the statement reads. According to the statement, other analysts include former internationals from top netball countries such as New Zealand, Australia, England and Jamaica. It further stated that SuperSport’s coverage will be anchored by top-rated Andee Mahamba, with a range of top local guests, all of whom represented the Proteas. In reaction, Waya said she is humbled but pledged to give an in-depth analysis of the tournament to enable viewers to understand and appreciate the competition. “This is the first Netball World Cup finals in Africa. To be given such a role it is humbling. I will be objective to enable viewers to enjoy and follow the games,” Waya, who works as Director of Netball in the Ministry of Sports, said. The Queens are currently in camp preparing for the tournament.

Boxing fraternity mourns Frank Chibisa
The boxing fraternity is grieving following the death of Malawi Professional Boxing Control Board (MPBCB) Second Vice President and spokesperson Frank Chibisa. Chibisa died Sunday at Mwaiwathu Private Hospital, where he had been taken after falling ill Sunday. Family representative Pemphero Kachipapa said the family was saddened by the death. “He was taken to the hospital in the morning [on Sunday]. He was having difficulties breathing and died while being assisted. Burial will take place on Tuesday in Zomba,” he said. MPBCB President Lonzoe Zimba said they have lost a dedicated official. “We have been hit hard. We have lost a very important person in boxing. He used his resources to support boxing bodies and boxers. When it came to boxing, he helped in areas where he was not even involved. “Started serving in the board after he had promoted a lot of local and international fights. In most cases, he operated on losses but did not stop supporting boxing,” he said. Chibisa emerged on the boxing scene in 2011 when he formed Ayaya Boxing Stable after picking Limbani Masamba as its leading boxer. He also opened a gym to help boxers in Chilomoni Township and surrounding areas. Later, MPBCB named Chibisa its chairperson for the South Boxing Committee before he was promoted to the post of National Chairman of Promotions. The board later appointed him second vice president and spokesperson. Meanwhile, one of the directors at Ayaya Boxing Stable Christopher Kasasi has said Chibisa’s death is a huge loss to boxing. “Just last week, he called me to his residence to start planning boxing activities. We have lost a person who was supportive and honest. He sacrificed his resources for boxing,” he said. The body of Chibisa will be buried in Thom Allan Village, TA Mwambo, Zomba Tuesday. Chibisa died aged 63 and is survived by five children and six grandchildren. His death comes two weeks after the boxing fraternity lost legendary boxer and promoter Bester Saopa

Tabitha Chawinga inspires PSG
Malawi Women’s National Football Team striker Tabitha Chawinga scored a brace as Paris Saint- Germain Women’s booked a quarterfinal final berth in the Coupe de France Feminine following 4-0 victory over CPB Brequiny Women’s on Sunday. The Malawian doubled the lead for PSG in the 50th minute after Magnaba Flouquet opened the scoring in the 35th minute. Amalie Vangsgaard scored the third goal of PSG in the 65th minute before Chawinga completed her brace two minutes later. FCB Head of Marketing and Communication Twikale Chirwa was speaking for the first time since the team defended the TNM Super League title, FDH Bank Cup, and won both the Castel Cup and Airtel Top 8. Chirwa pledged the bank’s continued support to the all-conquering side. “As a sponsor we are inspired by the club’s breaking achievement and we will continue to sponsor the People’s Team and activate the biggest fan base in the country. “The quadruple is a historic moment for the fans and the nation. It is what Bullets stand for. FCB believes in Bullets and the club is synonymous with our mantra “Belief Comes First”. We would like to congratulate the players, coach and entire staff for this feat,” Chirwa said. Chirwa said they never doubted Bullets when they decided to sponsor the team. “When we set out to sponsor Bullets, we believed it was the right choice for our brand and we believed in the fans. Our decision was based on unwavering support of the team by the fans with or without sponsorship. “At FCB, football is in our DNA having sponsored the Under-20 League for more than 15 years; it was time for our brand to graduate to sponsoring football at the elite level,” Chirwa said. He said they are delighted to be sponsoring Bullets as their expectation for the sponsorship has been exceeded by the performance of the team and professionalism of the coaching staff as well as administration. “We thank Bullets fans for supporting the team and First Capital Bank business,” he said. Chirwa also advised Bullets fans to be on the lookout for the new kit and “big promotion” that is in the pipeline. “In this light, we will parade the four trophies plus Charity Shield, in the City of Blantyre to showcase the team’s success in the historic first year of sponsorship,” he said. Bullets Chief Administration Officer Albert Chigoga said they are not surprised with FCB’s stance. “It is very obvious what the bank has said. Who would not like to partner a winning team? It is therefore pleasing to note that our sponsors are not regretting their decision to partner us,” Chigoga said. Chigoga said they would jointly work with the sponsors to successfully parade the trophies. “Indeed, there is a plan to do it. We will align with the sponsors on how best this can be done,” he said. Currently, Bullets have welcomed striker Babatunde Adepoju from South African side Venda Academy on a season-long deal while midfielder Lloyd Aaron has joined the side from Civil Service United.

Ntopwa optimistic on Super League return
By Tiyese Monjeza: Ntopwa FC have edged closer towards TNM Super League return after reaching the final of the Southern Region Football Association (SRFA) Premier Division after beating Zomba Airbase 6-5 on penalties at Zomba Airwing Ground on Sunday. In regulation time, the match ended 1-1, just as, the first leg. Yamikani Chaima put Ntopwa in the lead in the 38th minute before an Airbase player equalised from the penalty spot in the 42nd minute. Ntopwa owner and coach Jomo Osman was confident that his side can earn Super League promotion due to their experience in the top flight league. “We have the experience to handle big games. Our goal is to return to the Super League,” Osman said. Zomba Airbase Coach Gift Mnyenyembe said he was frustrated after his side failed to utilise home advantage to win the match. Meanwhile, SRFA Chairperson Raphael Humba has said they were yet to set a date for the final playoffs as they were still investigating a complaint from FCB Nyasa Big Bullets Reserve that Zingwangwa United fielded suspended players in their quarterfinal encounter. Depending on the ruling, the winner will face Fomo in two-legged semifinals and the winner from this tie will face Ntopwa in the final play-offs. Spectators paid K300 each to watch the semifinal.

FCB Nyasa Big Bullets get First Capital Bank’s seal of approval
Dominant FCB Nyasa Big Bullets have received a vote of confidence from their sponsors after the team completed a domestic quadruple, barely a year after partnering First Capital Bank (FCB). Bullets are owned by Nyasa Manufacturing Company who partnered with FCB in a three-year K525 million deal in March last year prior to the start of the season. FCB Head of Marketing and Communication Twikale Chirwa was speaking for the first time since the teamdefended the TNM Super League title, FDH Bank Cup, and won both the Castel Cup and Airtel Top 8. Chirwa pledged the bank’s continued support to the all-conquering side. “As a sponsor we are inspired by the club’s breaking achievement and we will continue to sponsor the People’s Team and activate the biggest fan base in the country. “The quadruple is a historic moment for the fans and the nation.

Mighty Mukuru Wanderers boss reviews deal
Mighty Mukuru Wanderers are keeping their fingers crossed after the team’s major financier and philanthropist Thom Mpinganjira revealed that he was reviewing his options as the contract draws to an end. The development comes after Wanderers finished the 2023 season without a trophy despite enjoying support from Mpinganjira. In an interview Sunday, Mpinganjira said he did not expect to spend much on football which, he claims, has ‘Lords’ who influence results. “I never envisaged spending so much money in the first place. I am currently reviewing my options following the events of the season. There are serious administrative shortfalls in football administration in Malawi. “A few powerful football Lords, sometimes heavily aligned to some clubs or against some clubs, horrible officiation, always last minute penalties or strangely disallowing goals. So, I am reviewing my options for now,” he said. Mpinganjira, through Ekhaya Farms Foods Limited, pumps in K410 million whereas Mukuru’s package is at K175 million annually. In June last year, the businessman toldThe Nationnewspaper that he would rather invest his money somewhere else than in a club that is failing to deliver. This was after Wanderers suffered a 1-0 shock loss to bottom-placed Extreme FC. In a recent interview, Mpinganjira admitted that it was not easy to turn Wanderers into a commercial entity to be a self-reliant side. “Efforts are being made. Hopefully we will see them come to fruition. But the environment is militating against this. This is why you have seen FCB joining Nyasa [Manufacturing Company] to beef up sponsorship because commercialisation efforts are not that easy to achieve so far,” he said. The entrepreneur expressed revelations oveer Malawi’s football administration. “My views are very clear on this. Football in Malawi will not go very far. Worse when our teams go outside because most of our football is not decided on the football pitch. I will stop there,” he said. Both Wanderers Chief Executive Officer Roosevelt Mpinganjira and Board Secretary and Legal Adviser Chancy Gondwe did not pick our calls. However, former Wanderers midfielder Sherry Msuku concurred with Mpinganjira. “As a major sponsor, he is supposed to review what was agreed in the contract before making any commitment. On the part of administration, I also agree that there is room for improvement. “On officiation, we have to understand that there is a thin line between biasness and incompetence. Besides that, referees, as humans, can make mistakes. On the other hand, teams, indeed, need multiple sources of income,” the former Flames player said. Wanderers finished on third position in the 2023 TNM Super League with 55 points from 30 matches, having won 15, drawn 10 and lost five times. The Nomads were booted out of the FDH Bank Cup by Mafco after losing 1-0 and they failed to defend the Airtel Top 8 Cup following controversy that marred their quarterfinal clash against Silver Strikers. Wanderers were also knocked out of the Castel Cup by bitter rivals Bullets.

Uncovering food safety gaps in rural households
By Temwani Mgunda: While many of us have encountered the unpleasant effects of consuming unsafe food that lead to illness, what often goes unnoticed are the hidden elements present in our food that pose significant health hazards in the long term. This sad realisation was shared recently at a food safety meeting in Lilongwe, where findings of a study on the role of mycotoxins and bacteria in human under-nutrition were disseminated. The study—conducted in Salima and Dedza districts— was carried out by the GIZ Malawi Food and Nutrition Security Programme (FNSP) in collaboration with Lilongwe University of Agriculture and Natural Resources (Luanar) and other partners. One of the major issues highlighted during the meeting is that consuming unsafe food relates specifically to mycotoxins, which are detrimental substances produced by moulds thriving on certain food items such as grains or groundnuts. A recent study conducted by Limbikani Matumba, a lecturer in the Faculty of Life Sciences and Natural Resources at Luanar, indicates that groundnuts are not the primary culprit when it comes to exposure to harmful mycotoxins, contrary to some prevailing beliefs. The research underscores that maize, a dietary staple in Malawi, is also significantly affected by mould. Given the integral role maize plays in the daily diet of most Malawians, particularly in the form of nsima, which cannot be missed for any proper meal, the study highlights that it is maize consumption that poses a substantial risk, potentially causing many Malawians to surpass recommended thresholds for mycotoxin exposure. “Contrary to common belief, maize consumption poses a higher risk of mycotoxin exposure in Malawi compared to groundnuts,” Matumba noted, adding that there is low awareness in the country on the issue of mycotoxins together with other issues like bacterial contamination and their health impacts. He said the study done in Dedza and Salima not only brings attention to the existing food safety knowledge gaps, but that it also serves as a caution to transform the way food safety is perceived and practised in Malawi. “Avoiding mouldy or contaminated foods at all times is crucial to prevent mycotoxin exposure. We can also reduce mycotoxins in grains by, among others, reducing toxigenic fungal population in growing plants and rapidly reduce moisture content of grains,” the professor of food safety advised. Some studies have established that esophageal cancer is also one of the health risks associated with prolonged exposure to mycotoxins and their presence in foods like maize and groundnuts might explain Malawi’s high rates of this type of cancer. The country had the highest overall rate of esophageal cancer in 2020 followed by Mongolia, according to research findings. ‘Do no harm’ One of the objectives of the GIZ FNSP is to ensure children in rural areas of Dedza and Salima receive the right foods for them to grow healthy and develop their full potential. Among the foods advocated by FNSP for this goal is groundnuts which, unfortunately, may contain high levels of mycotoxins. According to GIZ FNSP Team Leader, Martina Kress, following the principle of “do no harm”, the project—with support from the German Development Cooperation—initiated the study to look into aspects of food safety at household level. Kress said the formative study conducted in Dedza and Salima identified a significant lack of knowledge regarding food safety in communities in the two districts. “Compounding the issue, mycotoxins are also suspected to play a role in the occurrence of stunting, a condition where children’s growth falls behind their chronological age. Some of the mycotoxins found, for example fumonisin and aflatoxin, are known to contribute to stunting,” she said. In view of this revelation, FNSP and its partners have been diligently addressing the critical gaps in food safety knowledge with targeted interventions such as promoting diversified diets. “To reduce the dangers associated with exposure to harmful elements in our food, an effective approach involves adopting a diverse diet. Instead of consuming identical meals consistently, it’s advisable to eat one type of food today, a different one tomorrow, and another the following day,” Kress explained. She said dietary diversification significantly decreases the chances of encountering harmful substances while simultaneously enhancing the probability of obtaining essential nutrients. “Put simply, embracing dietary diversity is consistently beneficial for one’s health,” Kress said. Localising WHOs’ five keys to safer food The World Health Organisation (WHO) prescribes five ways of promoting food safety at all times. Known as the ‘WHO Five Keys to Safer Food’, they include keeping clean one’s hands, cooking tools and cooking space; separating raw and cooked food in terms of storage and the tools used to cut them; cooking thoroughly especially meat, poultry and seafood; keeping food at safe temperatures; and using safe water and raw materials when preparing food. To address this, FNSP localised and expanded the application of the ‘WHO Five Keys to Safer Food’ by incorporating mycotoxin prevention and control. The programme also developed a mini-recipe book for legume/ cereal complementary feeding based on the success of a three-month trial, which demonstrated the viability of germinated and non-germinated roasted cowpeas, soybeans, and common beans as alternatives to groundnuts. “We also created briefs covering essential topics, including effective handwashing, promotion of pulses/legumes in complementary feeding, and hand sorting as a strategy for managing mycotoxins in grains,” explained Kress, adding that they also trained staff in the FNSP intervention districts, serving as a pilot platform for testing and evaluating the food safety manual.

The white-saviour fantasy
Monday, we yet again celebrated the life of Reverend John Chilembwe, a true pan-Africanist who died fighting British colonialists in 1915. Chilembwe Day is a public holiday that is never short of controversy as some pockets of Malawians believe this man is overrated and he is not supposed to be hailed as a hero among us. In all honesty, most of the arguments that these critics raise reveal exactly what Chilembwe was fighting against – colonial subjugation that ensures that Africans remain ignorant of themselves and look up to Westerners as heroes. Some of those who argue against Chilembwe are quick to blurt that this man did nothing heroic as he only fought for his own rights in Chiradzulu District. Others go further to claim that had it not been for Chilembwe, Malawi would have been developed by now. They say that Chilembwe was too quick to chase the white man out of the country before that white man developed it. These people point to countries like South Africa where they say white people left late and developed that place. Such arguments are ridiculous and disappointing at the same time. They smell of ignorance. To begin with, Chilembwe is held as a hero, not because he liberated Nyasaland, but because he was the first man to stand up against colonial injustice. It is easy to speak from a place of comfort today about life during colonial occupation, but those who lived then will tell you that it was hell. Colonialism was a form of slavery brought home. Africans were enslaved in their own homelands and forced to work for free in mega farms whose output benefitted white people and not them. Colonialists owned almost all the land that they came upon, leaving black people beggars in their own land. Chilembwe and his army were against such injustices and it is absurd how and why somebody may want to look down at such courage. Another group of ignoramuses is of those who think colonialists came to Africa to develop the place. That may be what the imperialists tell you in their books, but it is not true. Colonialism was there to appropriate property for the colonial masters in Europe. These people came here to loot. It was even worse in settler colonies like Zimbabwe and South Africa – where the whites wanted to stay because the places had so many resources to exploit. These people invested in South Africa because they also took the land – made it theirs and subjected the natives to the worst form of segregation known as apartheid. Their stay there is nothing to smile about. It should not be surprising that, in their pretence at knowledge and understanding, some people choose to look down at pan-Africanist thinkers lie John Chilembwe. We are still living under Western dominance anyway, and the knowledge often produced for consumption in the mainstream is Eurocentric. It has always been part of the colonial project to ensure that black people and Africans should not think highly of themselves and their people. The hero should be the white man who has all the power to save us from damnation. Even his god reigns over our idols. That is what colonialism did to us. Today, we are still looking for white saviours as we continue to despise ourselves and our abilities. Even our political leadership believes that Malawi can develop with Western aid and guidance. We are still under the shackles of the International Monetary Fund and the World Bank. Our president and his team waste a lot of resources travelling to the West in search of white saviours. Perhaps we have not read simple books like Walter Rodney’sHow Europe Underdeveloped Africa,or Dambisa Moyo’sDead Aid.The answers to our questions are in our faces but we choose to close our eyes or look the other way. The name John Chilembwe should remind us that we need to be proud and stand tall as Africans. It is a name that must give birth to fight within our hearts. One thing we learn from this man is that it does not matter whether you win or not, but there is no other option in the face of injustice than to rise against the oppressor. It is amazing how today Chilembwe stands tall at Trafalgar Square – the heart of colonial authority – casting a shadow over white power. Now, that is a hero.

33 rivers risk flooding—Ministry
The Ministry of Water and Sanitation has, through the Department of Water Resources, observed that at least 33 major rivers across the country risk flooding due to rainfall activities in the past few days. The ministry says, in a statement released Monday, that the hydrometric monitoring system indicates that a substantial number of rivers are experiencing high water levels. The rivers include Likhubula, Likangala, Mkulumadzi, Lisungwe, Mtemang’ombe, Nkasi, Phalombe, Mombezi, Domasi, Naisi, Thutchira and Ruo in the Southern Region. The Central Region has Lingadzi, Lilongwe Linthipe, Rusa, Kasangazi, Mpasadzi, Lifuliza, Dwabanzi, Dwangwa, Bua and Nkula. In the Northern Region, rivers to watch out for include Luweya, South Rukuru, Kasitu, Lunyang’wa, North Rukuru, Lufira, Makeye, Songwe, Nyungwe and Chambo. “The ministry emphasises that given the current high-water levels and saturated soils, ongoing rainfall may lead to riverine floods in these areas. The public is strongly advised to exercise caution and remain vigilant for the potential occurrence of floods. “The public is further advised to pay attention to the continuously available updates on water levels/floods from the Department of Water Resources to be safe from any flood-related threats. The ministry has since asked Malawians to exercise caution when crossing rivers or engaging in any activities within these water bodies,” the statement reads. Currently, the Department of Disaster Management Affairs (Dodma) has indicated that around 14 councils have been affected by disasters, mainly stormy rains, strong winds and lightning since the onset of the 2023-24 rainy season. The affected councils include Chiradzulu, Dowa, Kasungu, Lilongwe, Mangochi, Mulanje, Mchinji, Nkhata Bay, Nkhotakota, Ntcheu, Nsanje, Rumphi, Salima and Thyolo. The disasters have affected approximately 21,379 people; that is, 4,751 households. Additionally, the department recorded five deaths (all caused by lightning strikes) and 46 injuries, primarily due to stormy rains, with 29 males and 17 females among the injured.

87% access farm inputs
By Deborah Madeya: Agriculture Minister Sam Kawale has said 87.4 percent of the 1.5 million Affordable Inputs Programme (AIP) beneficiaries have accessed inputs. He attributed the development to government’s steadfastness in addressing problems that have been flagged by beneficiaries. Kawale cited the arrest of vendors who attempted to buy fertiliser illegally as a manifestation of quick action taken on issues raised. “Right now, there are over 70 court cases involving those who were involved in the illegal purchase of fertiliser,” he said. Kawale was optimistic that the remaining 12.6 percent would be reached in due course. “We delivered fertiliser to hard-to-reach areas first and we will continue distributing fertiliser until everyone eligible has benefitted. “There are some points where we over-delivered and, so, the ministry is planning to shift that fertiliser to other places we have not reached yet,” Kawale said. Out of the 1.5 million beneficiaries, 1,490,000 are accessing fertiliser while the remaining 10,000 are accessing goats. Meanwhile, agricultural policy expert Ronald Chilumpha has said there is a need for the government to implement the reformed AIP. “Last year, government talked about a reformed AIP but we haven’t seen much of that in this season. “We want to see a diversified AIP; one that looks beyond farming. There are some areas that do not do well with maize, such that there is a need for them to be given an opportunity to grow other types of crops,” Chilumpha said. He added that the government should consider graduating from AIP and direct the money to other aspects of agriculture, including agriculture research and infrastructure development, for the country to achieve food security. “The money we are putting into AIP can be directed to irrigation schemes. As you know, the country lags behind, in terms of irrigation farming. “During seasons like this one, when the weather is unpredictable, irrigation can help the country meet its food security goals,” Chilumpha said.

Maputo Embassy chaos worries Public Accounts Committee
The Public Accounts Committee (Pac) of Parliament has expressed worry over perceived chaos at Malawi’s embassy in Maputo, Mozambique. Pac members expressed concern when officials from the Ministry of Foreign Affairs appeared before committee members to answer queries raised in the Auditor General (AG)’s report for the year ended June 2021. During the engagement, it was revealed that payments worth over K424 million were made without raising payment vouchers between November 2019 and June 2020. Committee members were also told that funds amounting to K11,324, 625 paid by an insurance company as compensation for a damaged vehicle used by a defence attaché were used for some other use other than replacing the damaged vehicle. Responding to the issue of money spent without raising vouchers, Principal Secretary (Legal) in the Ministry of Foreign Affairs Mary Kachale, who led the delegation, admitted that the observation made by the AG on the matter was accurate. “As you are aware, the payment process is an accounting function that requires a competent accountant. Unfortunately, there was no accountant who could undertake such functions “I am pleased to inform the honourable committee, honourable chairperson and honourable committee members, that the ministry has filled the vacant post and all accounting functions are being discharged accordingly,” Kachale said. However, Pac Vice Chairperson Ned Poya said it looks like the Mozambique Embassy is a playground for most people. “It’s kind of free for all. Imagine an embassy which doesn’t even know the date on which they purchased their assets… It’s free for all. And even the language in the letters shows that there is something wrong,” Poya said.

Uncovering food safety gaps in rural households
By Temwani Mgunda: While many of us have encountered the unpleasant effects of consuming unsafe food that lead to illness, what often goes unnoticed are the hidden elements present in our food that pose significant health hazards in the long term. This sad realisation was shared recently at a food safety meeting in Lilongwe, where findings of a study on the role of mycotoxins and bacteria in human under-nutrition were disseminated. The study—conducted in Salima and Dedza districts— was carried out by the GIZ Malawi Food and Nutrition Security Programme (FNSP) in collaboration with Lilongwe University of Agriculture and Natural Resources (Luanar) and other partners. One of the major issues highlighted during the meeting is that consuming unsafe food relates specifically to mycotoxins, which are detrimental substances produced by moulds thriving on certain food items such as grains or groundnuts. A recent study conducted by Limbikani Matumba, a lecturer in the Faculty of Life Sciences and Natural Resources at Luanar, indicates that groundnuts are not the primary culprit when it comes to exposure to harmful mycotoxins, contrary to some prevailing beliefs. The research underscores that maize, a dietary staple in Malawi, is also significantly affected by mould. Given the integral role maize plays in the daily diet of most Malawians, particularly in the form of nsima, which cannot be missed for any proper meal, the study highlights that it is maize consumption that poses a substantial risk, potentially causing many Malawians to surpass recommended thresholds for mycotoxin exposure. “Contrary to common belief, maize consumption poses a higher risk of mycotoxin exposure in Malawi compared to groundnuts,” Matumba noted, adding that there is low awareness in the country on the issue of mycotoxins together with other issues like bacterial contamination and their health impacts. He said the study done in Dedza and Salima not only brings attention to the existing food safety knowledge gaps, but that it also serves as a caution to transform the way food safety is perceived and practised in Malawi. “Avoiding mouldy or contaminated foods at all times is crucial to prevent mycotoxin exposure. We can also reduce mycotoxins in grains by, among others, reducing toxigenic fungal population in growing plants and rapidly reduce moisture content of grains,” the professor of food safety advised. Some studies have established that esophageal cancer is also one of the health risks associated with prolonged exposure to mycotoxins and their presence in foods like maize and groundnuts might explain Malawi’s high rates of this type of cancer. The country had the highest overall rate of esophageal cancer in 2020 followed by Mongolia, according to research findings. ‘Do no harm’ One of the objectives of the GIZ FNSP is to ensure children in rural areas of Dedza and Salima receive the right foods for them to grow healthy and develop their full potential.

33 rivers risk flooding—Ministry
The Ministry of Water and Sanitation has, through the Department of Water Resources, observed that at least 33 major rivers across the country risk flooding due to rainfall activities in the past few days.

Maputo Embassy chaos worries Public Accounts Committee

Malawi leads cholera deaths
By Mercy Matonga Malawi’s 2023 cholera outbreak led to the highest number of cholera deaths in a single country in 2023, a World Health Organisation (WHO) report has revealed. The report says Malawi’s death toll of 1,700 people also marked the deadliest cholera outbreak in the country’s history while, globally, Malawi’s number of cholera cases was more than that in any of the 30 other countries affected by cholera in 2023. Globally, there were over 667,000 cases and 4,000 deaths recorded, with Afghanistan registering the highest number of 215,210 cases despite registering fewer deaths than Malawi — 99 deaths, followed by Syria with 180,288 cases. In total, Malawi registered 59,114 cases. The report adds that several countries, Malawi inclusive, eventually received cholera vaccines to combat outbreaks. “Between 1 January 2023 and 31 December 2023, 12 countries submitted 30 requests for oral cholera vaccine (OCV) doses for emergency use. A total of 33 million doses were dispatched, fully allocating the available stockpile. “As of 9 January 2024, the global OCV stockpile stands at 1.1 million doses, which are available for allocation but not yet committed,” the report reads. Reacting to the report, Presidential Taskforce on Cholera co-Chairperson, Winfred Chalamira Nkhoma, toldThe Daily Timesthat the country was doing its best to avert the reemergence of the outbreak. “There is progressive work being done to scale up safe water sources in most communities; all of the kiosks that were closed due to inability to pay bills have been reopened by the water boards,” Nkhoma said. In a separate interview, Malawi Health Equity Network Executive Director George Jobe said that the government should focus on dispelling myths and misconceptions about cholera that contributed to the worsening of the outbreak. “We can speculate on the number of reasons for this but the truth is that cholera came soon after Covid, which was linked to a lot of beliefs. So, with the outbreak of cholera coming within the same period, people were connecting the two and people were seeking treatment very late,” Jobe said. WHO has since warned that as the rainy season begins in Southern East Africa, several countries are at risk of facing cholera outbreaks. However, Malawi is not among the countries specifically singled out as being under direct threat. “In Southeast Africa, several countries, including Burundi, Mozambique, Tanzania, Zambia, and Zimbabwe, are currently in their rainy season, which typically spans from October to April. The heightened rainfall during this period can result in the overflow of water sources and inadequate sanitation systems, leading to the mixing of sewage and drinking water, which creates prime conditions for cholera transmission. The risk is particularly acute in under-resourced areas, where access to clean water and sanitation facilities is limited,” the report warns. Meanwhile, as rains have begun in most parts of Malawi, the risk of outbreaks has increased, with the authorities saying between November last year and now, Malawi has registered 47 cholera cases from nine districts in the country.

Lazarus Chakwera lauds John Chilembwe vision
By Isaac Salima President Lazarus Chakwera has said his government will ensure that it continues implementing development projects in line with the vision that anti-colonial rule master Reverend John Chilembwe had for Malawi. The President said this at Providence Industrial Mission (PIM) in Chiradzulu District Monday, when he presided over activities marking Chilembwe Day. Chakwera said the reverend wanted the country to be liberated from bondage, hence the need to prolong such a vision. “His first vision was on education, where he put all his heart. He did not want to rely on others in the provision of education [services]. When education and digitalisation feature highly in Malawi 2063, they are derived from Chilembwe’s vision. “Soon, we will be opening 500 schools which the government has been constructing with support from [United States of] America and this is all about improving education [standards] in the country as Chilembwe wanted,” he said. He further said he would ensure that his leadership promotes industrialisation, just as Chilembwe aspired. “Chilembwe wanted the country to be food self-reliant, which is in accordance with our industrialisation drive. It is unfortunate that when Ngwazi [late President Hastings Kamuzu Banda] opened factories, the regime that followed later dismantled everything,” he said. Chakwera then said Chilembwe Day is a day of reflection on the sacrifice Chilembwe made to Malawi. He said Chilembwe loved the country and put aside his personal interest, such that he died fighting for the country. In recognition of the fallen anti-colonial activist, Chakwera has declared that Phalombe District Hospital will now be called Chilembwe District Hospital. The event started with the laying of wreaths, where Chakwera, First Lady Monica and Vice President Saulos Chilima led Malawians in laying wreaths at PIM Memorial Tower. The event was held under the theme ‘Extend Our Territory Lord’. PIM President Wilson Mitambo said it is high time the country focused on God as it seeks answers to challenges it is facing. “We should unite in asking God to extend our territory. The country has been facing a lot of challenges but this is time to leave everything aside and join hands in praying to God to hear us out,” Mitambo said.

Government borrows K1.8 trillion in 2023
The government’s borrowing through Treasury bills and Treasury notes in 2023 amounted to K1.8 trillion, with a marginal increase by 0.7 percent compared to 2022. This is according to the Bridgepath Capital Annual Report covering 2023. The report says during the 12-month period to December 2022, the government used Treasury notes and Treasury bills to borrow K1.83 trillion. The local financial advisory firm attributes the marginal increase to increasing fiscal deficits, which are being financed through both domestic and foreign borrowing. “The closing average TB yield increased to 18.90 percent in 2023 from 16.67 percent in 2022. Likewise, the closing average TN yield increased to 29.95 percent in 2023 from 25.7 percent in 2022,” the report reads. During the 2023-24 government fiscal year, the overall fiscal balance was estimated at a deficit of K1.32 trillion, which is 8.7 percent of GDP, an improvement of 0.01 percent from the previous year’s 8.8 percent likely outcome. The then minister of Finance and Economic Affairs Sosten Gwengwe said the deficit was to be financed through foreign borrowing amounting to K288.78 billion and domestic borrowing amounting to K1.19 trillion. During the 2024-25 pre-budget consultation, the Institute of Chartered Accountants in Malawi and the Malawi Confederation of Chambers of Commerce and Industry asked the government to work towards managing its debt. Icam Chief Executive Officer Noel Zigowa said borrowing is detrimental to the country’s economy because a lot of money is spent on interest payment, which cannot help the country to grow. “The government should manage existing debt and negotiate for better interests going forward because, as a country, we cannot continue spending huge amounts of money on interest,” he said. Speaking during the consultations, Minister of Finance and Economic Affairs Simplex Chithyola Banda said the government is working towards making sure that debt is sustainable. “The government has set out the macroeconomic framework for the 2024-25 budget that looks at the macroeconomic targets such as fiscal and monetary policy measures and the debt sustainability targets to be achieved by the end of the fiscal year,” Banda said. By November last year, Malawi’s total public debt stock had increased from K10.60 trillion to K12.56 trillion.

FCB Nyasa Big Bullets get First Capital Bank’s seal of approval
Dominant FCB Nyasa Big Bullets have received a vote of confidence from their sponsors after the team completed a domestic quadruple, barely a year after partnering First Capital Bank (FCB). Bullets are owned by Nyasa Manufacturing Company who partnered with FCB in a three-year K525 million deal in March last year prior to the start of the season. FCB Head of Marketing and Communication Twikale Chirwa was speaking for the first time since the teamdefended the TNM Super League title, FDH Bank Cup, and won both the Castel Cup and Airtel Top 8. Chirwa pledged the bank’s continued support to the all-conquering side. “As a sponsor we are inspired by the club’s breaking achievement and we will continue to sponsor the People’s Team and activate the biggest fan base in the country. “The quadruple is a historic moment for the fans and the nation. It is what Bullets stand for. FCB believes in Bullets and the club is synonymous with our mantra “Belief Comes First”. We would like to congratulate the players, coach and entire staff for this feat,” Chirwa said. Chirwa said they never doubted Bullets when they decided to sponsor the team. “When we set out to sponsor Bullets, we believed it was the right choice for our brand and we believed in the fans. Our decision was based on unwavering support of the team by the fans with or without sponsorship. “At FCB, football is in our DNA having sponsored the Under-20 League for more than 15 years; it was time for our brand to graduate to sponsoring football at the elite level,” Chirwa said. He said they are delighted to be sponsoring Bullets as their expectation for the sponsorship has been exceeded by the performance of the team and professionalism of the coaching staff as well as administration. “We thank Bullets fans for supporting the team and First Capital Bank business,” he said. Chirwa also advised Bullets fans to be on the lookout for the new kit and “big promotion” that is in the pipeline. “In this light, we will parade the four trophies plus Charity Shield, in the City of Blantyre to showcase the team’s success in the historic first year of sponsorship,” he said. Bullets Chief Administration Officer Albert Chigoga said they are not surprised with FCB’s stance. “It is very obvious what the bank has said. Who would not like to partner a winning team? It is therefore pleasing to note that our sponsors are not regretting their decision to partner us,” Chigoga said. Chigoga said they would jointly work with the sponsors to successfully parade the trophies. “Indeed, there is a plan to do it. We will align with the sponsors on how best this can be done,” he said. Currently, Bullets have welcomed striker Babatunde Adepoju from South African side Venda Academy on a season-long deal while midfielder Lloyd Aaron has joined the side from Civil Service United

Uncovering food safety gaps in rural households
By Temwani Mgunda: While many of us have encountered the unpleasant effects of consuming unsafe food that lead to illness, what often goes unnoticed are the hidden elements present in our food that pose significant health hazards in the long term. This sad realisation was shared recently at a food safety meeting in Lilongwe, where findings of a study on the role of mycotoxins and bacteria in human under-nutrition were disseminated. The study—conducted in Salima and Dedza districts— was carried out by the GIZ Malawi Food and Nutrition Security Programme (FNSP) in collaboration with Lilongwe University of Agriculture and Natural Resources (Luanar) and other partners. One of the major issues highlighted during the meeting is that consuming unsafe food relates specifically to mycotoxins, which are detrimental substances produced by moulds thriving on certain food items such as grains or groundnuts. A recent study conducted by Limbikani Matumba, a lecturer in the Faculty of Life Sciences and Natural Resources at Luanar, indicates that groundnuts are not the primary culprit when it comes to exposure to harmful mycotoxins, contrary to some prevailing beliefs. The research underscores that maize, a dietary staple in Malawi, is also significantly affected by mould. Given the integral role maize plays in the daily diet of most Malawians, particularly in the form of nsima, which cannot be missed for any proper meal, the study highlights that it is maize consumption that poses a substantial risk, potentially causing many Malawians to surpass recommended thresholds for mycotoxin exposure. “Contrary to common belief, maize consumption poses a higher risk of mycotoxin exposure in Malawi compared to groundnuts,” Matumba noted, adding that there is low awareness in the country on the issue of mycotoxins together with other issues like bacterial contamination and their health impacts. He said the study done in Dedza and Salima not only brings attention to the existing food safety knowledge gaps, but that it also serves as a caution to transform the way food safety is perceived and practised in Malawi. “Avoiding mouldy or contaminated foods at all times is crucial to prevent mycotoxin exposure. We can also reduce mycotoxins in grains by, among others, reducing toxigenic fungal population in growing plants and rapidly reduce moisture content of grains,” the professor of food safety advised. Some studies have established that esophageal cancer is also one of the health risks associated with prolonged exposure to mycotoxins and their presence in foods like maize and groundnuts might explain Malawi’s high rates of this type of cancer. The country had the highest overall rate of esophageal cancer in 2020 followed by Mongolia, according to research findings. ‘Do no harm’ One of the objectives of the GIZ FNSP is to ensure children in rural areas of Dedza and Salima receive the right foods for them to grow healthy and develop their full potential. Among the foods advocated by FNSP for this goal is groundnuts which, unfortunately, may contain high levels of mycotoxins. According to GIZ FNSP Team Leader, Martina Kress, following the principle of “do no harm”, the project—with support from the German Development Cooperation—initiated the study to look into aspects of food safety at household level. Kress said the formative study conducted in Dedza and Salima identified a significant lack of knowledge regarding food safety in communities in the two districts. “Compounding the issue, mycotoxins are also suspected to play a role in the occurrence of stunting, a condition where children’s growth falls behind their chronological age. Some of the mycotoxins found, for example fumonisin and aflatoxin, are known to contribute to stunting,” she said. In view of this revelation, FNSP and its partners have been diligently addressing the critical gaps in food safety knowledge with targeted interventions such as promoting diversified diets. “To reduce the dangers associated with exposure to harmful elements in our food, an effective approach involves adopting a diverse diet. Instead of consuming identical meals consistently, it’s advisable to eat one type of food today, a different one tomorrow, and another the following day,” Kress explained. She said dietary diversification significantly decreases the chances of encountering harmful substances while simultaneously enhancing the probability of obtaining essential nutrients. “Put simply, embracing dietary diversity is consistently beneficial for one’s health,” Kress said. Localising WHOs’ five keys to safer food The World Health Organisation (WHO) prescribes five ways of promoting food safety at all times. Known as the ‘WHO Five Keys to Safer Food’, they include keeping clean one’s hands, cooking tools and cooking space; separating raw and cooked food in terms of storage and the tools used to cut them; cooking thoroughly especially meat, poultry and seafood; keeping food at safe temperatures; and using safe water and raw materials when preparing food. To address this, FNSP localised and expanded the application of the ‘WHO Five Keys to Safer Food’ by incorporating mycotoxin prevention and control. The programme also developed a mini-recipe book for legume/ cereal complementary feeding based on the success of a three-month trial, which demonstrated the viability of germinated and non-germinated roasted cowpeas, soybeans, and common beans as alternatives to groundnuts. “We also created briefs covering essential topics, including effective handwashing, promotion of pulses/legumes in complementary feeding, and hand sorting as a strategy for managing mycotoxins in grains,” explained Kress, adding that they also trained staff in the FNSP intervention districts, serving as a pilot platform for testing and evaluating the food safety manual.

The white-saviour fantasy
Monday, we yet again celebrated the life of Reverend John Chilembwe, a true pan-Africanist who died fighting British colonialists in 1915. Chilembwe Day is a public holiday that is never short of controversy as some pockets of Malawians believe this man is overrated and he is not supposed to be hailed as a hero among us. In all honesty, most of the arguments that these critics raise reveal exactly what Chilembwe was fighting against – colonial subjugation that ensures that Africans remain ignorant of themselves and look up to Westerners as heroes. Some of those who argue against Chilembwe are quick to blurt that this man did nothing heroic as he only fought for his own rights in Chiradzulu District. Others go further to claim that had it not been for Chilembwe, Malawi would have been developed by now. They say that Chilembwe was too quick to chase the white man out of the country before that white man developed it. These people point to countries like South Africa where they say white people left late and developed that place. Such arguments are ridiculous and disappointing at the same time. They smell of ignorance. To begin with, Chilembwe is held as a hero, not because he liberated Nyasaland, but because he was the first man to stand up against colonial injustice. It is easy to speak from a place of comfort today about life during colonial occupation, but those who lived then will tell you that it was hell. Colonialism was a form of slavery brought home. Africans were enslaved in their own homelands and forced to work for free in mega farms whose output benefitted white people and not them. Colonialists owned almost all the land that they came upon, leaving black people beggars in their own land. Chilembwe and his army were against such injustices and it is absurd how and why somebody may want to look down at such courage. Another group of ignoramuses is of those who think colonialists came to Africa to develop the place. That may be what the imperialists tell you in their books, but it is not true. Colonialism was there to appropriate property for the colonial masters in Europe. These people came here to loot. It was even worse in settler colonies like Zimbabwe and South Africa – where the whites wanted to stay because the places had so many resources to exploit. These people invested in South Africa because they also took the land – made it theirs and subjected the natives to the worst form of segregation known as apartheid. Their stay there is nothing to smile about. It should not be surprising that, in their pretence at knowledge and understanding, some people choose to look down at pan-Africanist thinkers lie John Chilembwe. We are still living under Western dominance anyway, and the knowledge often produced for consumption in the mainstream is Eurocentric. It has always been part of the colonial project to ensure that black people and Africans should not think highly of themselves and their people. The hero should be the white man who has all the power to save us from damnation. Even his god reigns over our idols. That is what colonialism did to us. Today, we are still looking for white saviours as we continue to despise ourselves and our abilities. Even our political leadership believes that Malawi can develop with Western aid and guidance. We are still under the shackles of the International Monetary Fund and the World Bank. Our president and his team waste a lot of resources travelling to the West in search of white saviours. Perhaps we have not read simple books like Walter Rodney’sHow Europe Underdeveloped Africa,or Dambisa Moyo’sDead Aid.The answers to our questions are in our faces but we choose to close our eyes or look the other way. The name John Chilembwe should remind us that we need to be proud and stand tall as Africans. It is a name that must give birth to fight within our hearts. One thing we learn from this man is that it does not matter whether you win or not, but there is no other option in the face of injustice than to rise against the oppressor. It is amazing how today Chilembwe stands tall at Trafalgar Square – the heart of colonial authority – casting a shadow over white power. Now, that is a hero.

Under-20 coaching job up for grabs
Football Association of Malawi (Fam) has disclosed that it is not in a hurry to appoint Malawi Under-20 National Football Team coach due to the uncertainty of the Cosafa Youth Championship this year. This followsthe appointment of Patrick Mabedi as Flames senior coach on a two-year deal.He is also the Under-20 coach. Usually, the Cosafa Youth Championship takes place in December every year. However, Cosafa is yet to give an official update on the U-20 and U-17 tournament. Fam Emergency Executive Committee meeting held in Mangochi on Saturday, which approved the appointment of Mabedi, did not discuss his successor as U-20 coach. Fam President Walter Nyamilandu said the matter would be discussed at an appropriate time. “We would fill this vacancy at an appropriate time noting that there is no Cosafa U-20 tournament this year,” he said. Government, through the Ministry of Youth and Sports, supports the remunerations of the senior national football team coach as well as both U-17 and 20 boys’ national teams. Mabedi’s contract as U-20 coach is expected to expire next year just like his U-17 counterpart Deklerk Msakakuona, who is also Flames first assistant coach. However, Mabedi was not readily available Tuesday. Spokesperson for the Ministry of Youth and Sports Macmillan Mwale asked for more time before he could comment on the matter. “Let me verify information. I will come back to you,’’ Mwale said. Mabedi was appointed U-20 coach on a one-year deal in 2020. However, Mabedi’s contract was extended for two more years last year. While in charge of the U-20, the team failed to go past the group stage. Last year, the junior Flames finished second in the group stage with six points from three matches.

‘China expo ideal for Malawi trade’
By Dumbani Mzale, contributor, in Changsha, China: Minister of Trade Simplex Chithyola Banda has said the third China-Africa Economic and Trade Expo (Caete) presents a huge opportunity for Malawi to tackle her growing gap between imports and exports. Malawi is participating at the international exhibition which is slated to take place between June 29 and July 2, 2023 in Furong District, Hunan Province, Changsha City in the Asian country. President Lazarus Chakwera has been invited by his Chinese counterpart, Xi Jinping as a special guest of honour who will speak on behalf of Africa heads of State and Governments when he delivers his keynote address. Speaking yesterday on the sidelines of the preparations of the event, Chithyola described the event as “historic and very important” to Malawi as the country is also at the height of trying to look for new partners that can off-take most of the locally-produced commodities as a way of expanding the export base. “We have taken the opportunity of this third Caete to expose to China most of the value chains that we have in Malawi, in addition to soya beans. So, this is an opportunity for a country because we will definitely have new buyers on the market after this expo,” said the minister. Chithyola Banda, however, lamented that predominantly, most of Malawi markets have been within the Africa region since time immemorial, but quickly pointed out that his ministry, with joint efforts by other relevant ministries, departments and agencies, are now going beyond the African region, citing China, India and other strategic markets for Malawian products. The minister has stated that immediately after being appointed, he hit the ground running in order to explore new strategies, while trying to reduce the gap between imports and exports, and tackle the glaring trade imbalance. He said the current spate of economic challenges gripping Malawi are emanating from Malawi’s inability to export more on the international market, adding that the situation is impacting heavily on other key macroeconomic indicators such as inflation and indeed foreign exchange availability. Providing solution, Chithyola said so far, government has come up with a Customs Controlled Warehousing System, which he said will be key in tracking both the volume of the exports, as well as the value accrued from the proceeds of those exports, to the international market. “To address the two, we have collaborated with the Ministry of Finance, Ministry of Trade and also the Ministry of Agriculture, Malawi Revenue Authority (MRA) and Reserve Bank of Malawi (RBM). So if exporter A is exporting 20 kilogram to Tanzania, for argument’s sake, that information is already with MRA through Customs Controlled Warehousing, and the same information is with RBM because it is declared under CD1 forms. This, therefore, gives us a chance to ease monitoring and tracking of exports and also export proceeds,” he added. Last month, Chinese Ambassador to Malawi Long Zhou acknowledged that over the past three years, the Chakwera government has made progress to increase the number of exports that go into the Chinese market, stressing that during the period under review, several deals have been negotiated and agreed. Under the umbrella theme of “Common Development for a Shared Future,” the expo is expected to delve into key areas and emerging fields of China- Africa economic and trade cooperation, during which there will be 30 activities in five categories of major activities, high-end forums, matchmaking and negotiation, thematic seminars and other supporting activities. A 2023 Malawi government Annual Economic Report shows that the trade deficit improved from $2.07 billion in 2021 to $564.41 million in 2022, representing a 68 percent improvement.

Declare scabies an outbreak—Committee
The Parliamentary Committee of Health has asked the government to, through the Ministry of Health, declare that the country is facing a scabies outbreak. According to reports, over 4,000 cases have been registered across the country and children under the age of 15 are among the patients. Committee chairperson Matthews Ngwale said it is unfortunate that the Ministry of Health has been silent though cases continue to rise. “Since the first cases were registered in Mzuzu City and other districts in the Southern Region, the ministry has never shared with Malawians how it is dealing with the disease, which has gone out of hand. “As at now, our committee has received reports that many districts in the Central and Southern region have also registered cases. In terms of preparing for the crisis in Mzuzu, nobody did. Now the disease has gone out of hand as there are cases in Blantyre and Lilongwe, which means it is a national problem. We think that the ministry should declare scabies a disaster in our country,” Ngwale said. He further asked the government to stock public hospitals, including health centres both in rural and urban areas, with adequate drugs in order to contain the disease. District Environmental Health Officers President Chimwemwe Jella said the government should invest more funds in sensitising community members to hygiene and sanitation issues in order to contain the disease. “Let government equip our offices with resources so that we can reach out to the communities and sensitise people to issues related to the disease. By doing so, we are going to reduce the cases, particularly in rural areas,” Jella said. Similarly, Society of Medical Doctors (SMD) in Malawi said the ministry should take heed of pieces of advice to avert the recurrence of outbreaks such as cholera and Covid. SMD spokesperson Zaziwe Gundah said, to make matters worse, some public hospitals have inadequate drugs for scabies because the majority of district hospitals already drained their budgets. “The little which district hospitals are getting is being used for buying essential drugs. Scabies drugs are not a priority,” Gunda said. Ministry of Health spokesperson Adrian Chikumbe was not immediately available for a comment. According to the World Health Organisation, scabies is a contagious, intensely itchy skin condition caused by tiny, burrowing mites.

Civil Service United peg prized asset at K15 million
Civil Service United have pegged holding midfielder Lloyd Aaron at K15 million for any local side wishing to sign him. Aaron has emerged as a target for top TNM Super League teams, including Mighty Mukuru Wanderers, who inquired about the youngster. The development comes after reports indicated that the player wants to force his way out of the club by resigning to join one of the top teams in Blantyre. According to our findings, Civil inserted a clause in his contract whereby the club will be entitled to 15 percent if any local team buys the 22-year-old midfielder and sells him abroad. Civil General Secretary Edgar Chipalanjira could neither confirm nor deny the transfer fee placed on the Flames youngster, who graduated from the Malawi Under-20 National Football Team. “We are not at liberty to disclose the contents of the contract agreement with the player in public but it is true that primary negotiations between the two clubs started. “At this moment, Lloyd is still our [Civil] player and we should treat him as such,” he said. Lloyd impressed for the Flames at the Cosafa Cup in South Africa, where the side finished fourth. The youngster mesmerised fans with ball winning and distribution skills. Meanwhile, Wanderers acting Chief Executive Officer Roosevelt Mpinganjira has said they were told that the player was not for sale. “The information I have is that Civil are clinging to the player as they said he is not for sale,” Mpinganjira said. Civil already sold Christopher Kumwembe to Wanderers at K4.5 million before the start of the 2023 season.

Maso Awards race begins
The journey to the grand finale of the 2023 Maso Awards, to be held on November 25 2023 at Bingu International Convention Centre in Lilongwe, has begun following the opening of nominations Monday. Organisers, led by executive director Augustine Mukisi, said Monday that people should take time to nominate their favourite artists in the 32 categories. The launch of the nominations process comes barely two weeks after organisers announced the categories. “The Maso Awards 2023 nominations is a phase of the Maso Awards in which people get to choose nominees in different categories. As indicated, this year, we have 32 categories,” Mukisi said. He said, having opened the nomination today, the process would end on October 7 2023. Some of the categories include Best hip-Hop Act, Best Dancehall Act, Artist of the Year (male), Artist of the Year (female), Lifetime Achievement Award, which last year went to veteran musician Giddes Chalamanda, Song of the Year, Actor of the Year, Actress of the Year, Movie of the Year, Best Gospel Act, Best Comedian, Best Music Video, Best Sound Engineer, Best Photographer and Best Live Act. “This is the first phase of voting and, after nominations, we will come to the final round of voting, which starts on October 17 2023 and ends on November 17 2023,” Mukisi said. Having held the previous editions in Blantyre, Mukisi said they decided to move this year’s event to the capital city and that they will be rotating it.

Sports Arena on Bullets’ Caf Champions League game – 18 August 2023


Mwaiwathu Khupe is Miss Heritage Malawi 2023
Twenty-one-year old Mwaiwathu Khupe Sunday engraved her own history in the realm of pageantry when she was crowned Miss Heritage Malawi 2023 during its first live grand finale held at Amaryllis Hotel in Blantyre. Khupe, who is expected to represent the country at the Miss Heritage Global in South Africa from September 13 to 24 2023, outshone 13 other finalists to claim the crown, which was handed over to her by Miss Heritage Malawi 2022 Renee Marcolus. “It feels great to be crowned Miss Heritage Malawi 2023. I didn’t see this coming but glory be to God,” the soft-spoken Mwaiwathu, who is an entrepreneur, said. A holder of Bachelor’s Degree in Industrial Lab Technology from Malawi University of Business and Applied Sciences (Mubas), Mwaiwathu could not hold back tears of joy when her name was announced by Chief Judge Lucy Nkonjera close to midnight, drawing ecstasy from the audience that included her parents and relatives. As a winner, apart from travelling to South Africa in September, Mwaiwathu received items and packages alongside her first and second princesses, 21-year-old Victoria Michongwe, a holder of a Bachelor’s Degree in Business Administration from DMI University and 22-year old Rita Mwase, a fourth-year student of History and Social Studies at Domasi College of Education, who was also voted the Miss Influencer. Unlike in other pageants where contestants parade in a number of categories, the 14 finalists cat walked in an introductory category and later dinner wear before the judges came up with the top five that underwent a question and answer session before Mwaiwathu’s triumph. Earlier on, there was the crowning of Miss Personality which went to Daisy Shukran Maundala, Catherine Chimphanda (Miss Photogenic) and Yvonne Chanache (Miss Confidence). Chief Executive Officer and National Director of Miss Heritage Malawi, Madalo Mkuwu, described the event as a success. “The event was colourful and people came to support me. This is the beginning of more things to come, having been doing the selection through social media in the past two editions,” Mkuwu said. Hosted by renowned television personality Ruth Kulaisi, the red carpet event, that received a good audience, was spiced up by performances from Lulu and Mathumela Band, Goma Nyondo, Refilwe, DJ Gene and Tuno, who was the surprise guest on the night. The red carpet event, which received support from, among others, CTS Courier, Amaryllis Hotel and Entertainers Promotions and saw the presence of Miss Culture Malawi Memory Sanjira and Miss Heritage Malawi 2021 Juliana Banda, run under the theme ‘Mental Health’.

Crackdown on refugee ‘scam’
The Department of Immigration this week stopped 58 ‘refugees’ from boarding a plane at Kamuzu International Airport (KIA) enroute to the United States of America and Europe. This is the latest of Malawi government’s clampdowns in its bid to sanitise the refugee system in the country which some quarters fear has degenerated into an underworld of crime. The 58 are suspected to have been travelling under the refugee resettlement programme which officials and activists say has been turned into a criminal enterprise involving refugee impostors from West Africa and officials from the government and the United Nations High Commission for Refugees (UNHCR). We understand that some of the ‘refugees’ left the country on August 29, 2023, and others left on September 1, 2023 but were not in the Malawi refugees database. Sources in the refugee sector have toldMalawi Newsthat it is not the first time that people from other countries, especially West Africa, come to Malawi and collect resettlement papers and connect to their destinations especially the US. They said the refugee data base in Malawi has always remained the same despite government officials claiming that some refugees have left for resettlement in other countries. Government has confirmed that some on the list of the 58 were not in the database of the Refugees Commission in Malawi. The list is being scrutinised. Spokesperson for the Department of Immigration, Wellington Chiponde, confirmed the bust at KIA but he referredMalawi Newsto Ministry of Homeland Security for a detailed response. Minister of Homeland Security, Ken Zikhale Ng’oma, said they are investigating the matter. He added that government will scrutinise each and every refugee who is going abroad in a move to clean up the resettlement programme. “At Homeland Security, we try our level best to scrutinise every name, as the resettlement programme is for genuine refugees and not fraudsters. “We have always had suspicions about the mess in the refugee resettlement programme. “Our commitment is to refugee protection, not enriching rackets. There are so many questions that need answers on the refugee management. We shall get to the bottom of this fraud,” Zikhale N’goma said. He said the government is committed, as per international law, to protect refugees, and the ones abusing this system or benefiting are neither genuine refugees nor asylum seekers. Refugees are allowed to travel for resettlement if they meet the requirements as set out by the resettlement country and the Department of Immigration. Innocent Magambi, Chief Executive Officer for Inua Advocacy, a Lilongwe-based refugees’ rights organisation, said he is aware that some refugees have been stopped from travelling to the United States of America where they were expected to resettle. “While I can confirm that the resettlement scheme is used as a corruption scheme by the police, immigration department and UNHCR officials, some of the refugees that have been stopped are genuine and are here at Dzaleka,” Magambi said. He said it is sad that some of the refugees who have spent 14 to 30 years with refugee status, they have been denied the right to go to a country where they will have peace. “Do you know that UNHCR resettles less than one percent of the world’s refugee population annually? “If the refugees in Malawi have that chance, they should go and resettle, but the problem is that there are so many syndicates that are taking advantage of discriminatory refugee laws in Malawi,” Magambi said. In our earlier investigation, we revealed how some UNHCR officers at the camp and officials from the Ministry of Homeland Security and Department of Refugees were caught in fraudulent schemes that swindled desperate refugee families on the pretext that they would facilitate their relocation to Europe. The cats got out of the bag after the collapse of a deal involving a family of one refugee, a Burundian national named Protais Kamana, after he had allegedly paid K60 million to the officials to facilitate his family’s resettlement plan. His coming to Malawi was facilitated by a refugee who has been living in the camp for many years, but his trip ended up in one of the hotels in Lilongwe. Kamana arrived in the country in February this year and engaged the officials to facilitate the deal. However, six months later, he found himself at Dzaleka camp after the said officials duped him out of all his money. “I paid the money because the officials promised me that they would process my resettlement in Europe,” Kamana said in an interview. Kamana officially lodged a complaint with the Commissioner for Refugees in the Department of Refugees under the Ministry of Homeland Security and also with the police. The issue is in court in Dowa. Hearing of the matter took place on August 23, but the accused did not avail themselves to the court. Officials said the racket on resettlement of refugees abroad has been going on for too long, with both foreign and local officials involved promising these refugees better lives in Europe or Australia for a fee. When contacted on the phone, UNHCR country representative Modeste Koume toldMalawi Newsto go to his office, saying some issues could not be discussed on the phone. In the resettlement arrangement, refugees are selected and transferred from a country where they have sought protection to a third country that has permitted them to stay based on long-term or permanent residence status. The aim is to ensure that refugees are protected against forced return. It also provide them access to rights similar to those enjoyed by citizens, and allows them to eventually become citizens of the resettlement country. The UN Refugee Agency works closely with its partners to identify the most vulnerable refugees with urgent protection risks. But the final decision on whether or not a refugee will be resettled in a country is at the discretion of the country of resettlement. The scrutiny of the resettlement programme is yet another of government’s actions as it tries to clean up the refugee system. In the past few months, government has been moving back to Dzaleka Refugee Camp refugees who moved out of the camp and settled in the country’s towns and centres. In the past week, it has been examining containers it confiscated from refugee business people in case of any contraband items and to establish whether they have documentation to be doing business.

East Bridge directors look for markets
By Cathy Maulidi: East Bridge local directors have been outside the country for about three weeks now, searching for markets of produce they will get from the Malawi Government,The Daily Timeshas established. Recently, the government announced that it had signed a fertiliser deal with Romanian company East Bridge, further indicating that it is a commodity exchange arrangement. In the deal,Malawi is expected to pay back, in the form of produce,250,000 metric tonnes (mt) of soya beans at $528 per mt— which translates into $132,000,000 (K132 billion)— and 250,000mt of groundnuts at $725 per mt, costing $181,250,000 (K181.25 billion). According to information we have sourced, the directors have been to Djibouti, Kenya, Uganda and are now in Beira, Mozambique. The directors are Gloria Mphwiyo, Teddy Moya and Likhwa Mussa. Details at the office of the Registrar General indicate that East Bridge Estate Company shareholders are Haim Tzutziashvili, an Israel national, and George Mantea, Romanian national. “Yes, we have been travelling,” said one of the directors Likhwa Mussa. Mussa said their travelling outside Malawi is for business purposes. “We have a business to run. We have been going around to look for markets for Malawi commodities [these are commodities] that we are going to sell after supplying the fertiliser to Malawi,” he said. East Bridge company in Malawi is housed in Mussa’s house in Area 43/383/50 Mkango street, House number 50, Plot number 50. Meanwhile, civil rights group Forum for National Development has demanded that the government should explain and reveal the main people behind East Bridge deal. A statement, signed by the group’s chairperson Bright Kampaundi, says there is a need to make full disclosures of the contracts between the company and government. “It is crucial for the President to address the nation and array the fears that Malawi has lost more money due to business deals linked to fertiliser,” the statement reads. Reacting to this, government spokesperson Moses Kunkuyu said Malawi will not lose any money in the deal. The $124.5 million fertiliser deal has raised concerns and suspicions after it was alleged that East Bridge does not deal in fertiliser but pharmaceuticals. Recently, the Malawi Law Society wrote the Office of the Attorney General, Anti- Corruption Bureau and the Director of Public Prosecutions, asking them to investigate the Ministry of Agriculture’s fertiliser procurement deal with East Bridge Estate. A letter to the three government agencies, which the society’s president Patrick Mpaka signed and is dated July 4 2023, notes that there appears to be a violation of procurement and public finance management laws. “[There are violations of laws] starting with apparent failure to obtain certification from the Minister of Finance that funds were available for the procurement going through due diligence to initiation and conduct of procurement proceedings and ending with apparent illegitimacy of the signatures on the agreements,” it reads.

Atoht Manje’s family refuses postmortem
A somber mood engulfed Mzuzu Central Hospital (MCH) yesterday when the remains of renowned musician Atoht Manje, real name Elias Samson Missi, were being taken from the mortuary for his home in Mangochi. The artist died in the wee hours of Sunday soon after performing at University of Livingstonia, Law Campus, in Rumphi. Police detectives, Minister of Local Government, Culture and Unity Richard Chimwendo Banda, musicians and other people were at the mortuary to see off the musician to Mangochi. While some people in different gatherings were demanding postmortem to find out the cause of Atoht Manje’s death, the family refused postmortem saying “this is against our religion”. The artist’s grandfather, Kennedy Mbewe said the family had accepted the death of their son. Mbewe said they were in pain with the death of their son, who was a bread winner for the family. “We have been told that after he finished his performance, he felt uncomfortable because it was hot. He then poured cold water on himself and, later, he collapsed and was rushed to the hospital where he was pronounced dead,” he said. Mbewe admitted rejecting facilitation of postmortem, saying the family had accepted any cause of the death. Chimwendo Banda said the government has respected the family’s decision. The minister said President Lazarus Chakwera is saddened by Atoht Manje’s death. He said the government had provided transport to ferry the remains of the artist to Mangochi as well as provide support for the funeral ceremony. “We are shocked because we are losing young people in the music industry who would have helped develop the creative sector. This is the reason we have intervened with support as one way of respecting the musician,” Banda said. Before starting off to Mangochi, scores of people gathered at Chibavi Mosque where there were prayers. University of Livingstonia officials were part of the gathering throughout the entire send-off programme. According to the programme, the remains of the artist were supposed to go to Lilongwe but the family yesterday insisted to take the remains direct to Mangochi for burial today. Saint, real name Yamikani Chikwawe, declined to speak to the media but he told Chimwendo Banda that Atoht Manje was okay when both of them went on stage. Musicians Union of Malawi yesterday expressed shock with Atoht Manje’s death saying the creative sector had lost a talented artist who used music to promote and preserve the country’s culture. Several players and creatives also took to social media yesterday to mourn the artist, who with his Bazooka Vybz Band, established himself as a force in the music industry with his exceptional style of music and, on several occasions, dominated blank media levy collecting millions disbursed by Copyright Society of Malawi. Some of the songs he released include ‘Huwa’, ‘Ndalama’, ‘Munthu’, ‘Zili Bwino’, ‘Woyowoyo,’ ‘Unanditani’, ‘Majelsai’, ‘ Phone Ya Bae’, ‘Che Patuma’ and the latest ‘Nchape’. The artist was also set to release another song titled ‘Hussle’ next month, according to Moshu, who worked with Atoht Manje, producing a number of his songs. Born in 1989, Atoht Manje, who hailed from Nansenga- Sanyira Village in the Area of Traditional Authority Mponda in Mangochi, is survived by a wife and four children.

Uncovering food safety gaps in rural households
By Temwani Mgunda: While many of us have encountered the unpleasant effects of consuming unsafe food that lead to illness, what often goes unnoticed are the hidden elements present in our food that pose significant health hazards in the long term. This sad realisation was shared recently at a food safety meeting in Lilongwe, where findings of a study on the role of mycotoxins and bacteria in human under-nutrition were disseminated. The study—conducted in Salima and Dedza districts— was carried out by the GIZ Malawi Food and Nutrition Security Programme (FNSP) in collaboration with Lilongwe University of Agriculture and Natural Resources (Luanar) and other partners. One of the major issues highlighted during the meeting is that consuming unsafe food relates specifically to mycotoxins, which are detrimental substances produced by moulds thriving on certain food items such as grains or groundnuts. A recent study conducted by Limbikani Matumba, a lecturer in the Faculty of Life Sciences and Natural Resources at Luanar, indicates that groundnuts are not the primary culprit when it comes to exposure to harmful mycotoxins, contrary to some prevailing beliefs. The research underscores that maize, a dietary staple in Malawi, is also significantly affected by mould. Given the integral role maize plays in the daily diet of most Malawians, particularly in the form of nsima, which cannot be missed for any proper meal, the study highlights that it is maize consumption that poses a substantial risk, potentially causing many Malawians to surpass recommended thresholds for mycotoxin exposure. “Contrary to common belief, maize consumption poses a higher risk of mycotoxin exposure in Malawi compared to groundnuts,” Matumba noted, adding that there is low awareness in the country on the issue of mycotoxins together with other issues like bacterial contamination and their health impacts. He said the study done in Dedza and Salima not only brings attention to the existing food safety knowledge gaps, but that it also serves as a caution to transform the way food safety is perceived and practised in Malawi. “Avoiding mouldy or contaminated foods at all times is crucial to prevent mycotoxin exposure. We can also reduce mycotoxins in grains by, among others, reducing toxigenic fungal population in growing plants and rapidly reduce moisture content of grains,” the professor of food safety advised. Some studies have established that esophageal cancer is also one of the health risks associated with prolonged exposure to mycotoxins and their presence in foods like maize and groundnuts might explain Malawi’s high rates of this type of cancer. The country had the highest overall rate of esophageal cancer in 2020 followed by Mongolia, according to research findings. ‘Do no harm’ One of the objectives of the GIZ FNSP is to ensure children in rural areas of Dedza and Salima receive the right foods for them to grow healthy and develop their full potential. Among the foods advocated by FNSP for this goal is groundnuts which, unfortunately, may contain high levels of mycotoxins. According to GIZ FNSP Team Leader, Martina Kress, following the principle of “do no harm”, the project—with support from the German Development Cooperation—initiated the study to look into aspects of food safety at household level. Kress said the formative study conducted in Dedza and Salima identified a significant lack of knowledge regarding food safety in communities in the two districts. “Compounding the issue, mycotoxins are also suspected to play a role in the occurrence of stunting, a condition where children’s growth falls behind their chronological age. Some of the mycotoxins found, for example fumonisin and aflatoxin, are known to contribute to stunting,” she said. In view of this revelation, FNSP and its partners have been diligently addressing the critical gaps in food safety knowledge with targeted interventions such as promoting diversified diets. “To reduce the dangers associated with exposure to harmful elements in our food, an effective approach involves adopting a diverse diet. Instead of consuming identical meals consistently, it’s advisable to eat one type of food today, a different one tomorrow, and another the following day,” Kress explained. She said dietary diversification significantly decreases the chances of encountering harmful substances while simultaneously enhancing the probability of obtaining essential nutrients. “Put simply, embracing dietary diversity is consistently beneficial for one’s health,” Kress said. Localising WHOs’ five keys to safer food The World Health Organisation (WHO) prescribes five ways of promoting food safety at all times. Known as the ‘WHO Five Keys to Safer Food’, they include keeping clean one’s hands, cooking tools and cooking space; separating raw and cooked food in terms of storage and the tools used to cut them; cooking thoroughly especially meat, poultry and seafood; keeping food at safe temperatures; and using safe water and raw materials when preparing food. To address this, FNSP localised and expanded the application of the ‘WHO Five Keys to Safer Food’ by incorporating mycotoxin prevention and control. The programme also developed a mini-recipe book for legume/ cereal complementary feeding based on the success of a three-month trial, which demonstrated the viability of germinated and non-germinated roasted cowpeas, soybeans, and common beans as alternatives to groundnuts. “We also created briefs covering essential topics, including effective handwashing, promotion of pulses/legumes in complementary feeding, and hand sorting as a strategy for managing mycotoxins in grains,” explained Kress, adding that they also trained staff in the FNSP intervention districts, serving as a pilot platform for testing and evaluating the food safety manual.

The white-saviour fantasy
Monday, we yet again celebrated the life of Reverend John Chilembwe, a true pan-Africanist who died fighting British colonialists in 1915. Chilembwe Day is a public holiday that is never short of controversy as some pockets of Malawians believe this man is overrated and he is not supposed to be hailed as a hero among us. In all honesty, most of the arguments that these critics raise reveal exactly what Chilembwe was fighting against – colonial subjugation that ensures that Africans remain ignorant of themselves and look up to Westerners as heroes. Some of those who argue against Chilembwe are quick to blurt that this man did nothing heroic as he only fought for his own rights in Chiradzulu District. Others go further to claim that had it not been for Chilembwe, Malawi would have been developed by now. They say that Chilembwe was too quick to chase the white man out of the country before that white man developed it. These people point to countries like South Africa where they say white people left late and developed that place. Such arguments are ridiculous and disappointing at the same time. They smell of ignorance. To begin with, Chilembwe is held as a hero, not because he liberated Nyasaland, but because he was the first man to stand up against colonial injustice. It is easy to speak from a place of comfort today about life during colonial occupation, but those who lived then will tell you that it was hell. Colonialism was a form of slavery brought home. Africans were enslaved in their own homelands and forced to work for free in mega farms whose output benefitted white people and not them. Colonialists owned almost all the land that they came upon, leaving black people beggars in their own land. Chilembwe and his army were against such injustices and it is absurd how and why somebody may want to look down at such courage. Another group of ignoramuses is of those who think colonialists came to Africa to develop the place. That may be what the imperialists tell you in their books, but it is not true. Colonialism was there to appropriate property for the colonial masters in Europe. These people came here to loot. It was even worse in settler colonies like Zimbabwe and South Africa – where the whites wanted to stay because the places had so many resources to exploit. These people invested in South Africa because they also took the land – made it theirs and subjected the natives to the worst form of segregation known as apartheid. Their stay there is nothing to smile about. It should not be surprising that, in their pretence at knowledge and understanding, some people choose to look down at pan-Africanist thinkers lie John Chilembwe. We are still living under Western dominance anyway, and the knowledge often produced for consumption in the mainstream is Eurocentric. It has always been part of the colonial project to ensure that black people and Africans should not think highly of themselves and their people. The hero should be the white man who has all the power to save us from damnation. Even his god reigns over our idols. That is what colonialism did to us. Today, we are still looking for white saviours as we continue to despise ourselves and our abilities. Even our political leadership believes that Malawi can develop with Western aid and guidance. We are still under the shackles of the International Monetary Fund and the World Bank. Our president and his team waste a lot of resources travelling to the West in search of white saviours. Perhaps we have not read simple books like Walter Rodney’sHow Europe Underdeveloped Africa,or Dambisa Moyo’sDead Aid.The answers to our questions are in our faces but we choose to close our eyes or look the other way. The name John Chilembwe should remind us that we need to be proud and stand tall as Africans. It is a name that must give birth to fight within our hearts. One thing we learn from this man is that it does not matter whether you win or not, but there is no other option in the face of injustice than to rise against the oppressor. It is amazing how today Chilembwe stands tall at Trafalgar Square – the heart of colonial authority – casting a shadow over white power. Now, that is a hero.

33 rivers risk flooding—Ministry
The Ministry of Water and Sanitation has, through the Department of Water Resources, observed that at least 33 major rivers across the country risk flooding due to rainfall activities in the past few days. The ministry says, in a statement released Monday, that the hydrometric monitoring system indicates that a substantial number of rivers are experiencing high water levels. The rivers include Likhubula, Likangala, Mkulumadzi, Lisungwe, Mtemang’ombe, Nkasi, Phalombe, Mombezi, Domasi, Naisi, Thutchira and Ruo in the Southern Region. The Central Region has Lingadzi, Lilongwe Linthipe, Rusa, Kasangazi, Mpasadzi, Lifuliza, Dwabanzi, Dwangwa, Bua and Nkula. In the Northern Region, rivers to watch out for include Luweya, South Rukuru, Kasitu, Lunyang’wa, North Rukuru, Lufira, Makeye, Songwe, Nyungwe and Chambo. “The ministry emphasises that given the current high-water levels and saturated soils, ongoing rainfall may lead to riverine floods in these areas. The public is strongly advised to exercise caution and remain vigilant for the potential occurrence of floods. “The public is further advised to pay attention to the continuously available updates on water levels/floods from the Department of Water Resources to be safe from any flood-related threats. The ministry has since asked Malawians to exercise caution when crossing rivers or engaging in any activities within these water bodies,” the statement reads. Currently, the Department of Disaster Management Affairs (Dodma) has indicated that around 14 councils have been affected by disasters, mainly stormy rains, strong winds and lightning since the onset of the 2023-24 rainy season. The affected councils include Chiradzulu, Dowa, Kasungu, Lilongwe, Mangochi, Mulanje, Mchinji, Nkhata Bay, Nkhotakota, Ntcheu, Nsanje, Rumphi, Salima and Thyolo. The disasters have affected approximately 21,379 people; that is, 4,751 households. Additionally, the department recorded five deaths (all caused by lightning strikes) and 46 injuries, primarily due to stormy rains, with 29 males and 17 females among the injured.

87% access farm inputs
By Deborah Madeya: Agriculture Minister Sam Kawale has said 87.4 percent of the 1.5 million Affordable Inputs Programme (AIP) beneficiaries have accessed inputs. He attributed the development to government’s steadfastness in addressing problems that have been flagged by beneficiaries. Kawale cited the arrest of vendors who attempted to buy fertiliser illegally as a manifestation of quick action taken on issues raised. “Right now, there are over 70 court cases involving those who were involved in the illegal purchase of fertiliser,” he said. Kawale was optimistic that the remaining 12.6 percent would be reached in due course. “We delivered fertiliser to hard-to-reach areas first and we will continue distributing fertiliser until everyone eligible has benefitted. “There are some points where we over-delivered and, so, the ministry is planning to shift that fertiliser to other places we have not reached yet,” Kawale said. Out of the 1.5 million beneficiaries, 1,490,000 are accessing fertiliser while the remaining 10,000 are accessing goats. Meanwhile, agricultural policy expert Ronald Chilumpha has said there is a need for the government to implement the reformed AIP. “Last year, government talked about a reformed AIP but we haven’t seen much of that in this season. “We want to see a diversified AIP; one that looks beyond farming. There are some areas that do not do well with maize, such that there is a need for them to be given an opportunity to grow other types of crops,” Chilumpha said. He added that the government should consider graduating from AIP and direct the money to other aspects of agriculture, including agriculture research and infrastructure development, for the country to achieve food security. “The money we are putting into AIP can be directed to irrigation schemes. As you know, the country lags behind, in terms of irrigation farming. “During seasons like this one, when the weather is unpredictable, irrigation can help the country meet its food security goals,” Chilumpha said.

Maputo Embassy chaos worries Public Accounts Committee
The Public Accounts Committee (Pac) of Parliament has expressed worry over perceived chaos at Malawi’s embassy in Maputo, Mozambique. Pac members expressed concern when officials from the Ministry of Foreign Affairs appeared before committee members to answer queries raised in the Auditor General (AG)’s report for the year ended June 2021. During the engagement, it was revealed that payments worth over K424 million were made without raising payment vouchers between November 2019 and June 2020. Committee members were also told that funds amounting to K11,324, 625 paid by an insurance company as compensation for a damaged vehicle used by a defence attaché were used for some other use other than replacing the damaged vehicle. Responding to the issue of money spent without raising vouchers, Principal Secretary (Legal) in the Ministry of Foreign Affairs Mary Kachale, who led the delegation, admitted that the observation made by the AG on the matter was accurate. “As you are aware, the payment process is an accounting function that requires a competent accountant. Unfortunately, there was no accountant who could undertake such functions “I am pleased to inform the honourable committee, honourable chairperson and honourable committee members, that the ministry has filled the vacant post and all accounting functions are being discharged accordingly,” Kachale said. However, Pac Vice Chairperson Ned Poya said it looks like the Mozambique Embassy is a playground for most people. “It’s kind of free for all. Imagine an embassy which doesn’t even know the date on which they purchased their assets… It’s free for all. And even the language in the letters shows that there is something wrong,” Poya said.

Treasury raises tax target by K69 billion
The Treasury has raised the tax revenue target for the Malawi Revenue Authority (MRA) by K69 billion in the last three months of the 2023-24 financial year, Commissioner General John Bizwick has disclosed. Bizwick was speaking when he presented Commissioner General Awards to outstanding MRA stations which have sparkled in the first nine months of the fiscal year. The MRA chief said, initially, the tax collector was expected to collect K218 billion in January this year but that following the revision, the target has jumped to K245 billion. In February, MRA was initially expected to collect K155 billion which has now increased to K174 billion. The tax revenue target for March has been increased from K176 billion to K199 billion. Bizwick was optimistic that the tax collector would meet the revenue targets. “I am very, very confident that we should be able to collect that,” Bizwick said. He noted that the Commissioner General Awards are one way of energising the team to work hard and collect more. During the award ceremony, MRA presented awards in the areas Relegation Threatened Stations, Rising Stars, Hat Trick award and the overall Golden Boot award. MRA’s Large Taxpayers Office, which is mandated to collect about 70 percent of the total tax revenue, emerged the best performing station and carted home the Golden Boot award. MRA Deputy Commissioner for Large Taxpayers Office Rose Ngwira hailed her team for the strong performance. Ngwira also praised large taxpayers for paying taxes in time, which has resulted in the station performing above all MRA stations. According to MRA, the awards are designed to motivate stations to perform even better.

Tobacco Commission commences  tobacco survey
By Brenda Kayo: The Tobacco Commission (TC) has started the first round of crop assessment for the 2023-24 tobacco farming season to determine how much tobacco the country could produce this year. TC spokesperson Telephorus Chigwenembe said the exercise will run from January 15 to February 2. According to Chigwenembe, authorities will visit tobacco growing areas in the country for data collection. “We are requesting tobacco farmers to provide our teams with correct information because it is the correct information that enables the commission to come up with credible estimates that are used by players in the economy,” he said. He, however, said, so far, farmers have been licensed with quotas worth 248 million kilogrammes (kg) of all types of tobacco. The commission has since extended the licencing period to January 31 2024. Chigwenembe, however, said there will be no penalties and growers can pay for their registration and licencing after they sell their tobacco. Recently, the commission announced that there is an increase in seedbed area and planned hectares for this year’s tobacco production. In the 2022-23 farming season, 120 million kg of tobacco valued at $282.6 million was sold at an average price of $2.35.

Egenco hopeful on steady power generation, supply
Electricity Generation Company (Egenco) has expressed optimism on a steady supply of electricity during this year’s rainy season. The hope comes as the company has concluded maintenance works at Nkula B, effectively ending power outages of both Nkula A and B stations which affected power supply in the country over the weekend. In a statement, Egenco says intake screens which were dislodged at Nkula B have been replaced. The company also says it discovered a huge tree at its main inlet valve for machine 4 which has been removed. “As at 00:15hrs, all machines at both stations were back online and normalisation was complete. We thank our entire stakeholder and the public for your understanding and patience during this period,” the statement reads. Egenco Senior Public Relations Officer Moses Gwaza in an interview yesterday said the maintenance at Nkula B was part of preparations for the rainy season. “As you might be aware, once you have the intake screen dislodged, it means that anything can go into the machines. “So, to prevent that, we had to take out the power plant so that we have all the screens intact so that when we start cleaning the trash that normally comes with the rains, the machines are protected,” he said. Ironically, most parts of Mzuzu City had no power at the time of this story, which Gwaza said could be a local transmission problem. Commenting on the issue on Egenco’s Facebook page John Mlenga from Zolozolo Township said it is good that the company has moved in to rectify the problem though his township had no lights yet. “Good work Egenco even though we are in blackout in Mzuzu Zolozolo Botanic,” he said. Nkula A and B stations, which have a combined generation capacity of 135.1 megawatts, were shut down on January 13 to allow for maintenance works at Nkula B.

Anti- Corruption Bureau, Financial Intelligence Authority split over prosecution body
The Financial Intelligence Authority (FIA) sees more good than harm in plans to introduce an independent National Prosecution Authority (NPA). This is in sharp contrast to what the Anti- Corruption Bureau (ACB) said when its officials appeared before Legal Affairs Committee of Parliament members who heard from FIA officials Thursday. FIA Director General Jean Priminta, the authority’s director of legal affairs Edwin Mtonga and its public relations manager Masautso Ebere appeared before committee members, who are consulting stakeholders on whether the country needs the NPA. Before citing some advantages, Mtonga said the prosecuting agency would be effective because it would, among other things, have a more organised structure, specialised officers and financial autonomy without going through other structures to get funds. “Having a National Prosecuting Authority will make prosecution more organised and structured. It will give you proper conditions of service; it will give you proper equipment and processes. “It also gives you [an opportunity to know] how the decision is going to be made and how long they are supposed to make a decision. So, it means [being] more organised and structured,” Mtonga told the committee. On the disadvantages, he said having the NPA could mean making amendments to the Republican Constitution by coming up with a piece of legislation, something that may not be easy to do. He also said it might bring some rivalry and discontentment, as observed in Zimbabwe— since the authority has drawn lessons from Zimbabwe, South Africa and Zambia— where independent prosecuting agencies have proven to have advantages and disadvantages. “Centralisation may bring discontent because some law enforcement agencies, or other individual departments, may think that maybe the prosecutor-general may be compromised when it comes to high-profile cases or political cases,” he added. In her contribution during the meeting, Priminta said, at the moment, FIA provides intelligence to various authorities depending on cases such authorities deal with, adding that the relationship with all of them is good. “Currently, there are no issues between the FIA and the DPP [Director of Public Prosecutions]’s office; similarly, with such other agencies,” she said. Legal Affairs Committee of Parliament Chairperson Albert Mbawala said the committee had taken note of FIA’s contribution and is expected to meet other stakeholders before it recommends that the country should have NPA or not. “We are gathering information on the proposed establishment of the National Prosecution Authority that will basically take over from what we currently have as the Director of Public Prosecutions,” Mbawala said. The committee has already met ACB officials and is expected to meet the DPP and Malawi Police Service officials. When ACB officials engaged committee members, the bureau’s deputy director general Hillary Chilomba said no research has been conducted to show that the current system of prosecuting cases is faulty. He said when people are introducing something, there must be research done to unearth any mischief. Chilomba said some jurisdictions such as South Africa are even contemplating moving away from the NPA arrangement. “We, as ACB, are saying more research needs to be done because whenever you are introducing something, research must be done, which must bring what we call a mischief. In other words, it must indicate what problem is here. “Currently, we are saying that we have not seen that research paper, where they were supposed to show the problem. So, as at now, our position is that at least we know the mischief. So, the current arrangement we have, we think, is the best,” Chilomba said. He was quick to note that, if adopted, the NPA would bring its own challenges, saying it would mean that all the prosecution would be done by the new institution and that the ACB might be left with corruption prevention activities and investigations only.

Sulom giving football fraternity raw deal
If, in this country, there is a body that needs to wake up— and fast— it is the Super League of Malawi (Sulom). Without that long-awaited awakening, Sulom will continue to mess things up in this country. And that is just the way it is. I am saying this because I have observed that some Sulom officials keep shooting themselves in the foot. Such people seem to have a penchant for taking one step forward and two steps backwards. Take, for instance, the issue of coming up with season-long fixtures. When Sulom President Fleetwood Haiya indicated that he would end the chaos at Sulom by, among other things, ensuring that Super League teams have fixtures for the whole season, the move was regarded as one of the greatest feats in football administration in the country. In fact, it was regarded as something Malawi had never seen. Of course, yes. When I looked at the fixtures the Football Association of Malawi (Fam) affiliate released, I was impressed. I felt that the moment of positive change had come. As I feasted my eyes on the fixture, I felt like it seemed practical. Little did I know that it [the new system], perhaps, was not here to stay. Maybe it is here to stay but, every now and then, some people at Sulom will deliberately be forgetting it and pretending that they have done nothing wrong. And this is exactly what they did last Saturday, when they made people believe that— in line with the fixture that was released at the onset of the season, Blantyre-based Mighty Waka-Waka Tigers would face team of the moment Chitipa United. It was not to be. Someone, or some people, at Sulom knew that the match had been shifted to the next day [Sunday] but did not even bother to inform some stakeholders by, say, Friday or even Thursday. Someone who is employed to do just that at Sulom chose to keep quiet about it while enjoying tea, cocoa, coffee or whatever keeps people busy— or makes them forgetful— these days. My own cousin travelled all the way from Nsanje to watch the match on Saturday, only to be given a bluff meal by, of all people, those responsible for fixtures at Sulom. In my case, I was at the Umhlangano wa Maseko Ngoni annual cultural festival in Ntcheu District on Saturday morning but was intent on being at Mpira Stadium in Blantyre on the dot so that I could watch the match at Mpira Stadium. Guess what? I only learned about the change of match day three hours before time, when I had already left Ntcheu District. I know many people who were inconvenienced by Sulom’s regrettable behaviour. Talk of advertisers who booked radio and television slots on the understanding that the match between Mighty Waka- Waka Tigers and Chitipa United would be played on Saturday. People must realise that they cannot run football they way my grandpa back in the village runs a ndagala. Far from it. When, back then, I was one of the people that learned about Football Public Relations and Marketing when Fifa and Fam organised the training in Malawi in the early 2000s, this is not what we learned. What we learned, instead, is that football can be used for building relationships and financial bases. Football is the real deal. The mighty unifier. But someone at Sulom is taking all this, and football lovers, for granted by pushing them left, right and centre. Why should people at Sulom secretariat be detached from stakeholders? We must not forget that Sulom has a fully-fledged secretariat but, guess what, people there spend more time thinking about nobody-knows-what instead of engaging in constant communication with journalists and all who matter in football. It is simple to keep the fire of football burning; keep communicating and make it constant. There must be no time for on-the-job-training at Sulom. Malawians cannot continue to be subjected to inefficiencies at Sulom. Wake up— and now.

Sir Paul Banda moves to Blantyre to access dialysis
Veteran musician Sir Paul Banda has briefly moved to Chatha in Blantyre from his base in Balaka to easily access dialysis at Queen Elizabeth Central Hospital in Blantyre. Dialysis is the process of removing excess water, solutes and toxins from the blood in people whose kidneys can no longer perform these functions naturally. The legendary musician told Musicians Union of Malawi (Mum) President Vita Chirwa and Secretary General Tonny Chitimatima, when they visited him, that, with fuel shortage the country is experiencing and other challenges, he decided to move to Blantyre for now. “There have been moments where I have missed dialysis and I have ended up getting very sick. So, atleast here in Blantyre, I can always jump in a minibus and access dialysis. I have to go for it twice a week,” he said. The musician has been accessing dialysis for three years now, having started at Mwaiwathu Private Hospital before moving to Queen Elizabeth Central Hospital. He said he misses the stage and that, for now, he was trying to practice the guitar so as to rediscover his art, having been on a long break. As he continues to recover, Sir Paul also said he wants to take up a role of teaching children how to play the guitar. “I love music and I am passionate about it. I miss it but I cannot do it now because of my health. So, as I recover, I want to be teaching children here how to play the guitar, keep them busy and also pass on the knowledge,” the artist, who has trained several musicians in the country, said. He then thanked Chirwa and Chitimatima for visiting him. Chirwa and Chitimatima also took time out with Sir Paul to play, freestyle, some of his songs. “We thought it wise to come and visit the legend just to cheer him up,” the Mum leader said. Before visiting Sir Paul, the two also cheered veteran bassist Francis Chintembo, who is admitted to Queen Elizabeth Central Hospital following an accident last week. Chintembo, one of the original members of Kalimba Band famed for the hit ‘Sometimes I Wonder’, was hit by a motor cyclist, who was trying to avoid a truck in Mpemba, Blantyre. The bassist, who sustained serious injuries in the head and leg, said he was getting better although he was still in pain.

KIM, KBG seeks to spark ambition in Malawi creatives
Musicians KIM of Diamonds and KBG, who are among the 2023 Mandela Washington fellows and currently in United States of America (USA), have said their mission is to drive determination in fellow creatives in the country as well as empower them to dream big. KIM real name Kimberley Kaunda , who is based at University of Texas in Austin, said through her social media page that by strengthening “our local music industry, we can effect positive change in the lives of young talents and our nation as a whole”. “Collaboration is key, as music knows no boundaries. As a Mandela Washington Fellow 2023, I want to empower young African talent on a journey of musical transformation as a young African leader,” she said. The Lilongwe-based singer-songwriter and consultant said music is her lifeblood and that she was thrilled to share that she was living her dream as well as working in her dream job. She said she has preserved and found her true calling and that today with three albums, two Extended Playlists (EPs) and several singles, she is driven a greater purpose—to bring impactful change to the Malawian and African music industry. KIM shared more on Music Business Academy for Africa, a program focused on understanding and operating within the African music business landscape. “In 2021, I became an A&R consultant and community manager for Nvak Foundation & Nvak Collective, empowering emerging artists worldwide through education, mentorship, and direct grants. It was a life-changing opportunity,” she said. The musician said enrolling in the Music Business Academy for Africa further solidified her position in the market and that she made it to the top 10 of the Music Business Academy for Africa programme which allowed her to network with brilliant young minds in Lagos, Nigeria. “Now, as a young African leader selected for the Mandela Washington Fellowship, I see the urgent need for innovative and impactful leaders in the Malawian music industry. We must build a supportive and connected community, breaking beyond our borders to reach global audiences,” she said. KBG real name Kelvin Before Gumbi, who was recently invited to take on photography at Des Monies Arts Festival, said as a Mandela Washington Fellow 2023, he will document his experience through pictures and small video clips so that those who are interested in the programme can see what it is all about. “There are a lot of young people doing amazing things across Africa and we should make it a point to learn and network if African young leaders want to take this continent to the next level,” he said. Based at University of Drake, KBG spoke vastly about systems looking at transportation, infrastructure, education, creative industries and food. US Embassy Public Affairs Officer Namita Biggins said recently that the Mandela Washington Fellowship is the flagship programme of the Young African Leaders Initiative (Yali) which is the US government’s signature effort to invest in the next generation of African leaders

Karonga United out to add Mighty Mukuru Wanderers woes
In-form Karonga United have threatened to pile more pressure on Mighty Mukuru Wanderers when they meet this afternoon in the TNM Super League at Kamuzu Stadium. Karonga have never lost any match under new coach Trevor Kajawa, having won four matches and drawn once. Wanderers are smarting from the FDH Bank Cup exit after losing 0-1 to Mafco at Kamuzu Stadium on Saturday. Last week, the Nomads failed to collect maximum points in the league, when they came from behind to draw 1-1 against Kamuzu Barracks at the same venue. However, Kajawa said facing Wanderers will be tough as their counterparts are eager to put smiles on their supporters’ faces. “We are facing a side which is not doing well but this should not concern us. We are here to play our game. We plan to win to have a chance to break into the top four,” Kajawa said. If Karonga win, they will remain fifth on the log table. Currently, Karonga have 31 points from 21 games and are tied on points with Bangwe All Stars, who have played a game more. Meanwhile, Wanderers will be eyeing a win to dislodge Chitipa United at the summit of the log table. The Nomads are third with 37 points from 20 matches and can top the table as Chitipa have 39 points at the summit. Assistant coach Albert Mpinganjira said it is a must-win game for the Lali Lubani Road side. “We cannot do otherwise, apart from winning the game, to give back something to our supporters,” Mpinganjira said. In the first round, Wanderers won 2-1 at Karonga Stadium.

Council pays Malawi Queens’ external allowances
Malawi National Netball Team players can now afford a smile all the way to the bank after Malawi National Council of Sports (MNCS) paid them external travel allowances worth K30 million for participating in the 2023 Netball World Cup finals in Cape Town, South Africa. The development comes as a relief to the Queens who normally sweat to receive their dues. Sports Council Public Relations and Communications Officer Edgar Ntulumbwa said the amount covers external allowances but does not include game bonuses. “We released funds amounting to K30 million covering external allowances. We promised them that their money would be ready a week after they return home and we did just that,” he said, adding that the money was deposited straight into the players’ accounts. Ntulumbwa said they were waiting for a report from Netball Association of Malawi (Nam) to process game bonuses. “We cannot issue payment without the report because it is treated as a requisition. Once Nam submits the report, we will also initiate the payment process,” he said. Nam General Secretary Isaac Chimwala confirmed that Sports Council had indeed paid the players. “The money was indeed paid directly into the players’ accounts,” Chimwala said. One of Queens’ senior players also confirmed receiving the money. “The money was indeed paid into our accounts, so all is well for now. It is our hope now that Nam will quickly prepare the report so that Sports Council pays us all our dues,” the player said. The Queens had an unsuccessful campaign at the global showpiece where they finished seventh. This was their worst finish in 20 years, having been stuck on position six after similar competitions in 2011, 2015 and 2019. Malawi achieved their best ever finish in 2007 when they ended fifth after making their debut in world netball in 1995. In that year’s tournament, they ended on position eight before falling to 11th in 1999. Malawi’s free fall continued in 2003 when they failed to qualify for the global championship. But they returned with a bang four years later to achieve their best finish. Despite featuring a star-studded line-up in attack, the Queens lacked balance and struggled against lowly ranked sides such as seventh-placed Tonga Nation, 19th ranked Fiji and Scotland, who are ranked 10th. At the tournament, which was the first ever in Africa, the Queens defeated Scotland 62- 39, Barbados 84-48, Fiji 62-48 and twice beat Tonga 56-51 and 64-54. However, Malawi suffered three defeats when they went down to England 62-39, Australia 70-46 and Uganda 57-46.

Gabon opposition claims victory in presidential poll
The opposition in Gabon has claimed victory following Saturday’s presidential election, but official results have not yet been released. President Ali Bongo was running for a third term, which would also be an extension of rule by the Bongo dynasty which stretches back more than half a century. At a press conference on Monday, the campaign manager of the main opposition candidate, Albert Ondo Ossa, announced without offering proof that the partial vote count was in their favour and he had a clear lead. In Gabon, only the Gabonese Election Centre is authorised by law to publish results. “What is now expected of [President Bongo] is that he accepts the sovereign choice of the Gabonese people, that he respects it and that he organises, without bloodshed, the transfer of power to Ossa,” Mike Jocktane, Ossa’s campaign manager, said. Despite the opposition claims, the electoral body has remained silent over progress of the vote count and when the final results will be released. The opposition has also denounced “fraud” in the elections. Meanwhile, the internet outage and a curfew imposed by government are still in place. On Monday evening, residents in the capital, Libreville, raced against time to respect curfew hours. Some who could not make it in time were reportedly stranded in far-away areas.—BBC

Is Malawi leveraging regional integration?
From July 7 to 9, the African Union (AU) led the continent in commemorating African Integration Day under the theme ‘Accelerating Job Creation, Digital and Financial Inclusion in the African Continental Free Trade Area (AfCFTA) Market’. The initiative dates back to 2019 when AU Heads of State and Government designated July 7 as African integration day to celebrate major achievements in regional and continental integration. Africa’s integration has an overarching goal of achieving an African Economic Community at continental level, using six successive stages, which include the strengthening of sectoral cooperation and the creation of regional free trade areas, establishment of a continental customs union, a common market and monetary and economic union. Malawi entered into numerous trade integration agreements such as the AfCFTA, Comesa, Sadc. But what has she earned from such pacts? President of the Cross-border Traders Association of Malawi Steve Yohane says there are huge opportunities for local traders on the international market but that they are frustrated by Non- Tariff Barriers (NTBs). “There are a lot of barriers that are created mainly to protect economies. So, NTBs are a hindrance. We want as many agencies as possible to know the impact those NTBs have on international trade,” Yohane said. NTB is a way of restricting trade using trade barriers in any form other than a tariff. According to Comesa, intra-regional trade is currently at seven percent, which is partly because of the Non-Tariff Barriers to trade. President of the Malawi Union of Small and Medium Enterprises Barbara Banda says Malawi has not benefitted from integration. “We recently witnessed a group of SMEs with tomatoes held at Songwe and being perishable. The traders were crying at the risk of losing their product and coming back home to face the lenders who gave them money. “No policies should be implemented without enough awareness among the stakeholders. In my capacity as president of SMEs, it was my first time to hear that there was a policy prohibiting importation of produce under certain conditions. At the regional level, there is no trust and intentionality to produce a product by adding value at the competitive point of production,” Banda said. But Director of Trade in Goods at the Ministry of Trade and Industry Charity Musonzo said discussions are at an advanced stage involving all trade blocks which Malawi is party to. “We are participating in a tripartite arrangement that is bringing together Sadc, the East African Community (EAC) and Comesa. Between the three blocs, we have an online platform where any stakeholder can report on any encounter where such issues will be dealt with on a case-by-case basis,” Musonzo said. Comesa Senior Customs Affairs Officer Balness Sumani says the body has come up with regulations as well as reporting tools to resolve the NTBs which are affecting intra-regional trade under the bloc. “In terms of rules of origin, we insist to the need to build capacity and sensitise the traders to rules of origin so that they understand that their goods are required to meet certain criteria for those goods to be cleared duty free under the Comesa trade agreement,” Sumani said.

Uncovering food safety gaps in rural households
By Temwani Mgunda: While many of us have encountered the unpleasant effects of consuming unsafe food that lead to illness, what often goes unnoticed are the hidden elements present in our food that pose significant health hazards in the long term. This sad realisation was shared recently at a food safety meeting in Lilongwe, where findings of a study on the role of mycotoxins and bacteria in human under-nutrition were disseminated. The study—conducted in Salima and Dedza districts— was carried out by the GIZ Malawi Food and Nutrition Security Programme (FNSP) in collaboration with Lilongwe University of Agriculture and Natural Resources (Luanar) and other partners. One of the major issues highlighted during the meeting is that consuming unsafe food relates specifically to mycotoxins, which are detrimental substances produced by moulds thriving on certain food items such as grains or groundnuts. A recent study conducted by Limbikani Matumba, a lecturer in the Faculty of Life Sciences and Natural Resources at Luanar, indicates that groundnuts are not the primary culprit when it comes to exposure to harmful mycotoxins, contrary to some prevailing beliefs. The research underscores that maize, a dietary staple in Malawi, is also significantly affected by mould. Given the integral role maize plays in the daily diet of most Malawians, particularly in the form of nsima, which cannot be missed for any proper meal, the study highlights that it is maize consumption that poses a substantial risk, potentially causing many Malawians to surpass recommended thresholds for mycotoxin exposure. “Contrary to common belief, maize consumption poses a higher risk of mycotoxin exposure in Malawi compared to groundnuts,” Matumba noted, adding that there is low awareness in the country on the issue of mycotoxins together with other issues like bacterial contamination and their health impacts. He said the study done in Dedza and Salima not only brings attention to the existing food safety knowledge gaps, but that it also serves as a caution to transform the way food safety is perceived and practised in Malawi. “Avoiding mouldy or contaminated foods at all times is crucial to prevent mycotoxin exposure. We can also reduce mycotoxins in grains by, among others, reducing toxigenic fungal population in growing plants and rapidly reduce moisture content of grains,” the professor of food safety advised. Some studies have established that esophageal cancer is also one of the health risks associated with prolonged exposure to mycotoxins and their presence in foods like maize and groundnuts might explain Malawi’s high rates of this type of cancer. The country had the highest overall rate of esophageal cancer in 2020 followed by Mongolia, according to research findings. ‘Do no harm’ One of the objectives of the GIZ FNSP is to ensure children in rural areas of Dedza and Salima receive the right foods for them to grow healthy and develop their full potential. Among the foods advocated by FNSP for this goal is groundnuts which, unfortunately, may contain high levels of mycotoxins. According to GIZ FNSP Team Leader, Martina Kress, following the principle of “do no harm”, the project—with support from the German Development Cooperation—initiated the study to look into aspects of food safety at household level. Kress said the formative study conducted in Dedza and Salima identified a significant lack of knowledge regarding food safety in communities in the two districts. “Compounding the issue, mycotoxins are also suspected to play a role in the occurrence of stunting, a condition where children’s growth falls behind their chronological age. Some of the mycotoxins found, for example fumonisin and aflatoxin, are known to contribute to stunting,” she said. In view of this revelation, FNSP and its partners have been diligently addressing the critical gaps in food safety knowledge with targeted interventions such as promoting diversified diets. “To reduce the dangers associated with exposure to harmful elements in our food, an effective approach involves adopting a diverse diet. Instead of consuming identical meals consistently, it’s advisable to eat one type of food today, a different one tomorrow, and another the following day,” Kress explained. She said dietary diversification significantly decreases the chances of encountering harmful substances while simultaneously enhancing the probability of obtaining essential nutrients. “Put simply, embracing dietary diversity is consistently beneficial for one’s health,” Kress said. Localising WHOs’ five keys to safer food The World Health Organisation (WHO) prescribes five ways of promoting food safety at all times. Known as the ‘WHO Five Keys to Safer Food’, they include keeping clean one’s hands, cooking tools and cooking space; separating raw and cooked food in terms of storage and the tools used to cut them; cooking thoroughly especially meat, poultry and seafood; keeping food at safe temperatures; and using safe water and raw materials when preparing food. To address this, FNSP localised and expanded the application of the ‘WHO Five Keys to Safer Food’ by incorporating mycotoxin prevention and control. The programme also developed a mini-recipe book for legume/ cereal complementary feeding based on the success of a three-month trial, which demonstrated the viability of germinated and non-germinated roasted cowpeas, soybeans, and common beans as alternatives to groundnuts. “We also created briefs covering essential topics, including effective handwashing, promotion of pulses/legumes in complementary feeding, and hand sorting as a strategy for managing mycotoxins in grains,” explained Kress, adding that they also trained staff in the FNSP intervention districts, serving as a pilot platform for testing and evaluating the food safety manual.

The white-saviour fantasy
Monday, we yet again celebrated the life of Reverend John Chilembwe, a true pan-Africanist who died fighting British colonialists in 1915. Chilembwe Day is a public holiday that is never short of controversy as some pockets of Malawians believe this man is overrated and he is not supposed to be hailed as a hero among us. In all honesty, most of the arguments that these critics raise reveal exactly what Chilembwe was fighting against – colonial subjugation that ensures that Africans remain ignorant of themselves and look up to Westerners as heroes. Some of those who argue against Chilembwe are quick to blurt that this man did nothing heroic as he only fought for his own rights in Chiradzulu District. Others go further to claim that had it not been for Chilembwe, Malawi would have been developed by now. They say that Chilembwe was too quick to chase the white man out of the country before that white man developed it. These people point to countries like South Africa where they say white people left late and developed that place. Such arguments are ridiculous and disappointing at the same time. They smell of ignorance. To begin with, Chilembwe is held as a hero, not because he liberated Nyasaland, but because he was the first man to stand up against colonial injustice. It is easy to speak from a place of comfort today about life during colonial occupation, but those who lived then will tell you that it was hell. Colonialism was a form of slavery brought home. Africans were enslaved in their own homelands and forced to work for free in mega farms whose output benefitted white people and not them. Colonialists owned almost all the land that they came upon, leaving black people beggars in their own land. Chilembwe and his army were against such injustices and it is absurd how and why somebody may want to look down at such courage. Another group of ignoramuses is of those who think colonialists came to Africa to develop the place. That may be what the imperialists tell you in their books, but it is not true. Colonialism was there to appropriate property for the colonial masters in Europe. These people came here to loot. It was even worse in settler colonies like Zimbabwe and South Africa – where the whites wanted to stay because the places had so many resources to exploit. These people invested in South Africa because they also took the land – made it theirs and subjected the natives to the worst form of segregation known as apartheid. Their stay there is nothing to smile about. It should not be surprising that, in their pretence at knowledge and understanding, some people choose to look down at pan-Africanist thinkers lie John Chilembwe. We are still living under Western dominance anyway, and the knowledge often produced for consumption in the mainstream is Eurocentric. It has always been part of the colonial project to ensure that black people and Africans should not think highly of themselves and their people. The hero should be the white man who has all the power to save us from damnation. Even his god reigns over our idols. That is what colonialism did to us. Today, we are still looking for white saviours as we continue to despise ourselves and our abilities. Even our political leadership believes that Malawi can develop with Western aid and guidance. We are still under the shackles of the International Monetary Fund and the World Bank. Our president and his team waste a lot of resources travelling to the West in search of white saviours. Perhaps we have not read simple books like Walter Rodney’sHow Europe Underdeveloped Africa,or Dambisa Moyo’sDead Aid.The answers to our questions are in our faces but we choose to close our eyes or look the other way. The name John Chilembwe should remind us that we need to be proud and stand tall as Africans. It is a name that must give birth to fight within our hearts. One thing we learn from this man is that it does not matter whether you win or not, but there is no other option in the face of injustice than to rise against the oppressor. It is amazing how today Chilembwe stands tall at Trafalgar Square – the heart of colonial authority – casting a shadow over white power. Now, that is a hero.

33 rivers risk flooding—Ministry
The Ministry of Water and Sanitation has, through the Department of Water Resources, observed that at least 33 major rivers across the country risk flooding due to rainfall activities in the past few days. The ministry says, in a statement released Monday, that the hydrometric monitoring system indicates that a substantial number of rivers are experiencing high water levels. The rivers include Likhubula, Likangala, Mkulumadzi, Lisungwe, Mtemang’ombe, Nkasi, Phalombe, Mombezi, Domasi, Naisi, Thutchira and Ruo in the Southern Region. The Central Region has Lingadzi, Lilongwe Linthipe, Rusa, Kasangazi, Mpasadzi, Lifuliza, Dwabanzi, Dwangwa, Bua and Nkula. In the Northern Region, rivers to watch out for include Luweya, South Rukuru, Kasitu, Lunyang’wa, North Rukuru, Lufira, Makeye, Songwe, Nyungwe and Chambo. “The ministry emphasises that given the current high-water levels and saturated soils, ongoing rainfall may lead to riverine floods in these areas. The public is strongly advised to exercise caution and remain vigilant for the potential occurrence of floods. “The public is further advised to pay attention to the continuously available updates on water levels/floods from the Department of Water Resources to be safe from any flood-related threats. The ministry has since asked Malawians to exercise caution when crossing rivers or engaging in any activities within these water bodies,” the statement reads. Currently, the Department of Disaster Management Affairs (Dodma) has indicated that around 14 councils have been affected by disasters, mainly stormy rains, strong winds and lightning since the onset of the 2023-24 rainy season. The affected councils include Chiradzulu, Dowa, Kasungu, Lilongwe, Mangochi, Mulanje, Mchinji, Nkhata Bay, Nkhotakota, Ntcheu, Nsanje, Rumphi, Salima and Thyolo. The disasters have affected approximately 21,379 people; that is, 4,751 households. Additionally, the department recorded five deaths (all caused by lightning strikes) and 46 injuries, primarily due to stormy rains, with 29 males and 17 females among the injured.

87% access farm inputs
By Deborah Madeya: Agriculture Minister Sam Kawale has said 87.4 percent of the 1.5 million Affordable Inputs Programme (AIP) beneficiaries have accessed inputs. He attributed the development to government’s steadfastness in addressing problems that have been flagged by beneficiaries. Kawale cited the arrest of vendors who attempted to buy fertiliser illegally as a manifestation of quick action taken on issues raised. “Right now, there are over 70 court cases involving those who were involved in the illegal purchase of fertiliser,” he said. Kawale was optimistic that the remaining 12.6 percent would be reached in due course. “We delivered fertiliser to hard-to-reach areas first and we will continue distributing fertiliser until everyone eligible has benefitted. “There are some points where we over-delivered and, so, the ministry is planning to shift that fertiliser to other places we have not reached yet,” Kawale said. Out of the 1.5 million beneficiaries, 1,490,000 are accessing fertiliser while the remaining 10,000 are accessing goats. Meanwhile, agricultural policy expert Ronald Chilumpha has said there is a need for the government to implement the reformed AIP. “Last year, government talked about a reformed AIP but we haven’t seen much of that in this season. “We want to see a diversified AIP; one that looks beyond farming. There are some areas that do not do well with maize, such that there is a need for them to be given an opportunity to grow other types of crops,” Chilumpha said. He added that the government should consider graduating from AIP and direct the money to other aspects of agriculture, including agriculture research and infrastructure development, for the country to achieve food security. “The money we are putting into AIP can be directed to irrigation schemes. As you know, the country lags behind, in terms of irrigation farming. “During seasons like this one, when the weather is unpredictable, irrigation can help the country meet its food security goals,” Chilumpha said.

Maputo Embassy chaos worries Public Accounts Committee
The Public Accounts Committee (Pac) of Parliament has expressed worry over perceived chaos at Malawi’s embassy in Maputo, Mozambique. Pac members expressed concern when officials from the Ministry of Foreign Affairs appeared before committee members to answer queries raised in the Auditor General (AG)’s report for the year ended June 2021. During the engagement, it was revealed that payments worth over K424 million were made without raising payment vouchers between November 2019 and June 2020. Committee members were also told that funds amounting to K11,324, 625 paid by an insurance company as compensation for a damaged vehicle used by a defence attaché were used for some other use other than replacing the damaged vehicle. Responding to the issue of money spent without raising vouchers, Principal Secretary (Legal) in the Ministry of Foreign Affairs Mary Kachale, who led the delegation, admitted that the observation made by the AG on the matter was accurate. “As you are aware, the payment process is an accounting function that requires a competent accountant. Unfortunately, there was no accountant who could undertake such functions “I am pleased to inform the honourable committee, honourable chairperson and honourable committee members, that the ministry has filled the vacant post and all accounting functions are being discharged accordingly,” Kachale said. However, Pac Vice Chairperson Ned Poya said it looks like the Mozambique Embassy is a playground for most people. “It’s kind of free for all. Imagine an embassy which doesn’t even know the date on which they purchased their assets… It’s free for all. And even the language in the letters shows that there is something wrong,” Poya said.

Treasury raises tax target by K69 billion
The Treasury has raised the tax revenue target for the Malawi Revenue Authority (MRA) by K69 billion in the last three months of the 2023-24 financial year, Commissioner General John Bizwick has disclosed. Bizwick was speaking when he presented Commissioner General Awards to outstanding MRA stations which have sparkled in the first nine months of the fiscal year. The MRA chief said, initially, the tax collector was expected to collect K218 billion in January this year but that following the revision, the target has jumped to K245 billion. In February, MRA was initially expected to collect K155 billion which has now increased to K174 billion. The tax revenue target for March has been increased from K176 billion to K199 billion. Bizwick was optimistic that the tax collector would meet the revenue targets. “I am very, very confident that we should be able to collect that,” Bizwick said. He noted that the Commissioner General Awards are one way of energising the team to work hard and collect more. During the award ceremony, MRA presented awards in the areas Relegation Threatened Stations, Rising Stars, Hat Trick award and the overall Golden Boot award. MRA’s Large Taxpayers Office, which is mandated to collect about 70 percent of the total tax revenue, emerged the best performing station and carted home the Golden Boot award. MRA Deputy Commissioner for Large Taxpayers Office Rose Ngwira hailed her team for the strong performance. Ngwira also praised large taxpayers for paying taxes in time, which has resulted in the station performing above all MRA stations. According to MRA, the awards are designed to motivate stations to perform even better.

Tobacco Commission commences  tobacco survey
By Brenda Kayo: The Tobacco Commission (TC) has started the first round of crop assessment for the 2023-24 tobacco farming season to determine how much tobacco the country could produce this year. TC spokesperson Telephorus Chigwenembe said the exercise will run from January 15 to February 2. According to Chigwenembe, authorities will visit tobacco growing areas in the country for data collection. “We are requesting tobacco farmers to provide our teams with correct information because it is the correct information that enables the commission to come up with credible estimates that are used by players in the economy,” he said. He, however, said, so far, farmers have been licensed with quotas worth 248 million kilogrammes (kg) of all types of tobacco. The commission has since extended the licencing period to January 31 2024. Chigwenembe, however, said there will be no penalties and growers can pay for their registration and licencing after they sell their tobacco. Recently, the commission announced that there is an increase in seedbed area and planned hectares for this year’s tobacco production. In the 2022-23 farming season, 120 million kg of tobacco valued at $282.6 million was sold at an average price of $2.35.

Egenco hopeful on steady power generation, supply
Electricity Generation Company (Egenco) has expressed optimism on a steady supply of electricity during this year’s rainy season. The hope comes as the company has concluded maintenance works at Nkula B, effectively ending power outages of both Nkula A and B stations which affected power supply in the country over the weekend. In a statement, Egenco says intake screens which were dislodged at Nkula B have been replaced. The company also says it discovered a huge tree at its main inlet valve for machine 4 which has been removed. “As at 00:15hrs, all machines at both stations were back online and normalisation was complete. We thank our entire stakeholder and the public for your understanding and patience during this period,” the statement reads. Egenco Senior Public Relations Officer Moses Gwaza in an interview yesterday said the maintenance at Nkula B was part of preparations for the rainy season. “As you might be aware, once you have the intake screen dislodged, it means that anything can go into the machines. “So, to prevent that, we had to take out the power plant so that we have all the screens intact so that when we start cleaning the trash that normally comes with the rains, the machines are protected,” he said. Ironically, most parts of Mzuzu City had no power at the time of this story, which Gwaza said could be a local transmission problem. Commenting on the issue on Egenco’s Facebook page John Mlenga from Zolozolo Township said it is good that the company has moved in to rectify the problem though his township had no lights yet. “Good work Egenco even though we are in blackout in Mzuzu Zolozolo Botanic,” he said. Nkula A and B stations, which have a combined generation capacity of 135.1 megawatts, were shut down on January 13 to allow for maintenance works at Nkula B.

Tabitha Chawinga inspires PSG
Malawi Women’s National Football Team striker Tabitha Chawinga scored a brace as Paris Saint- Germain Women’s booked a quarterfinal final berth in the Coupe de France Feminine following 4-0 victory over CPB Brequiny Women’s on Sunday. The Malawian doubled the lead for PSG in the 50th minute after Magnaba Flouquet opened the scoring in the 35th minute. Amalie Vangsgaard scored the third goal of PSG in the 65th minute before Chawinga completed her brace two minutes later. FCB Head of Marketing and Communication Twikale Chirwa was speaking for the first time since the team defended the TNM Super League title, FDH Bank Cup, and won both the Castel Cup and Airtel Top 8. Chirwa pledged the bank’s continued support to the all-conquering side. “As a sponsor we are inspired by the club’s breaking achievement and we will continue to sponsor the People’s Team and activate the biggest fan base in the country. “The quadruple is a historic moment for the fans and the nation. It is what Bullets stand for. FCB believes in Bullets and the club is synonymous with our mantra “Belief Comes First”. We would like to congratulate the players, coach and entire staff for this feat,” Chirwa said. Chirwa said they never doubted Bullets when they decided to sponsor the team. “When we set out to sponsor Bullets, we believed it was the right choice for our brand and we believed in the fans. Our decision was based on unwavering support of the team by the fans with or without sponsorship. “At FCB, football is in our DNA having sponsored the Under-20 League for more than 15 years; it was time for our brand to graduate to sponsoring football at the elite level,” Chirwa said. He said they are delighted to be sponsoring Bullets as their expectation for the sponsorship has been exceeded by the performance of the team and professionalism of the coaching staff as well as administration. “We thank Bullets fans for supporting the team and First Capital Bank business,” he said. Chirwa also advised Bullets fans to be on the lookout for the new kit and “big promotion” that is in the pipeline. “In this light, we will parade the four trophies plus Charity Shield, in the City of Blantyre to showcase the team’s success in the historic first year of sponsorship,” he said. Bullets Chief Administration Officer Albert Chigoga said they are not surprised with FCB’s stance. “It is very obvious what the bank has said. Who would not like to partner a winning team? It is therefore pleasing to note that our sponsors are not regretting their decision to partner us,” Chigoga said. Chigoga said they would jointly work with the sponsors to successfully parade the trophies. “Indeed, there is a plan to do it. We will align with the sponsors on how best this can be done,” he said. Currently, Bullets have welcomed striker Babatunde Adepoju from South African side Venda Academy on a season-long deal while midfielder Lloyd Aaron has joined the side from Civil Service United.

Ntopwa optimistic on Super League return
By Tiyese Monjeza: Ntopwa FC have edged closer towards TNM Super League return after reaching the final of the Southern Region Football Association (SRFA) Premier Division after beating Zomba Airbase 6-5 on penalties at Zomba Airwing Ground on Sunday. In regulation time, the match ended 1-1, just as, the first leg. Yamikani Chaima put Ntopwa in the lead in the 38th minute before an Airbase player equalised from the penalty spot in the 42nd minute. Ntopwa owner and coach Jomo Osman was confident that his side can earn Super League promotion due to their experience in the top flight league. “We have the experience to handle big games. Our goal is to return to the Super League,” Osman said. Zomba Airbase Coach Gift Mnyenyembe said he was frustrated after his side failed to utilise home advantage to win the match. Meanwhile, SRFA Chairperson Raphael Humba has said they were yet to set a date for the final playoffs as they were still investigating a complaint from FCB Nyasa Big Bullets Reserve that Zingwangwa United fielded suspended players in their quarterfinal encounter. Depending on the ruling, the winner will face Fomo in two-legged semifinals and the winner from this tie will face Ntopwa in the final play-offs. Spectators paid K300 each to watch the semifinal.
