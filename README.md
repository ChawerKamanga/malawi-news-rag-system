## RAG System for Personalized Malawi News
This project leverages a fantastic mix of BeautifulSoup, LLM (gpt-3-turbo + Langchain) to create an intelligent chat interface. It employs the Retrieval Augmented Generation (RAG) method, enabling the AI chat to access the most recent news from local Malawian sources. As a result, it can respond to queries and provide insights using the latest available information, rather than solely relying on its training data. This approach effectively creates a dynamic and well-informed AI chat, showcasing the potential of RAG in enhancing AI capabilities.
