## RAG System for Personalized Malawi News
This project uses this awesome combo of BeautifulSoup, LLM (gpt-3-turbo + Langchain) to make a really smart chat interface. It uses Retrieval Augmented Generation (RAG) to give the AI chat access to the latest news from local Malawian news sources. This way, it can answer questions and give insights based on the most up-to-date information, instead of just what it was trained on. It's a really effective way to create an AI chat that's informed and dynamic, and it shows how RAG can be used to make AI even smarter!
